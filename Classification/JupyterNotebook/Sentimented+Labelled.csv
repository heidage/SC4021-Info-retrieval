Target is the middle and the middle is being eroded. Is the magnitude of the trade down sustainable? I don't know but I do think that the longer this trade down occurs and the more those people shop at WMT the more ingrained that becomes. How does Target compete against that? The primary thing is likely they have to compete on price, which is not great. Tariffs will be another issue. I would not be surprised if there is a new CEO sooner than later, but what can they really do?

So, I don't know. From my perspective, a problem I have with Target is that I look at the broader issues and I don't see it changing any time soon or easy answers to solve it.  That said, given what the stock has done and the situation as is at this point in time, how much of that is baked into the stock? It feels like the kind of thing where okay news could - at least temporarily - cause a nice rally. Any sort of improvement in the tariff situation could cause a rally.

I don't have anything against it really but I don't get the appeal. That said, I think the issue with JPM (and which will be more of an issue with something like SoFi) is that people view what's going on as a potential slowdown.

That ‚Äúbit of extra‚Äù is called the yield. A Treasury is basically that. It‚Äôs an instrument where the government borrows money and agrees to pay back more after a period of time. So the 10-year Treasury is a loan the government will pay back in 10 years with a little extra.

Now let‚Äôs say I buy a Treasury for $10 and get $11 back from the government over 10 years. That‚Äôs a 10% return over its life, or about 0.96% annually if compounded, but roughly 1%/year if simplified. We call that a 1% yield.

Why does dumping bonds make the price go down? Simple supply and demand ‚Äî just like selling stocks makes their prices go down. If you suddenly sell a lot of anything, the price drops because supply overwhelms demand. Now, China has almost $800 billion in Treasuries (and they are also a big buyer, which creates demand). Japan holds even more ‚Äî about $1 trillion. That can move markets.

And remember, even if China holds only a small fraction of total outstanding Treasuries, what matters is the float ‚Äî that is, how much is being bought and sold at a given time. For example, say typically 1% of the houses in your city are on sale at any time. Now some real estate mogul decides to sell all his houses, which make up 2% of the housing stock. That‚Äôs a small fraction of all the homes in the city ‚Äî but it triples the supply that‚Äôs for sale. There aren‚Äôt enough buyers for that. So prices drop. A lot.

Even though it‚Äôs just a 2% change in total inventory, it‚Äôs a huge disruption to the normal market activity. Japan and China can flush the Treasury market in a similar way. If they sell a lot at once, there simply won‚Äôt be enough buyers ready with cash ‚Äî and that‚Äôs what we call a liquidity crunch or low-liquidity situation.  Since China is a big Treasury buyer, they can affect the demand side too by stopping their buying.  

Remember that bond that paid $11 that I bought for $10??  Now let‚Äôs say I sell that bond for $8 because someone is dumping bonds and prices are falling. That bond still pays $11 over its life. So the person who buys it from me is getting a $3 gain on an $8 investment ‚Äî or a 37.5% total return over 10 years. That translates into about 3.2% annually (compounded) ‚Äî a big jump from the original 1% yield!

So as you can see, as bond prices go down, yields go up ‚Äî they move inversely.
Now, the next time the government wants to borrow money, it can‚Äôt offer the old 1% yield anymore. Why? Because people can just go buy that 3.2% yielding bond on the open market. To compete, the government has to raise the interest rate on new bonds to match what the market is demanding. So it ends up paying more to borrow money.

Why Is This Important?

Because the 10-year Treasury yield is a benchmark ‚Äî many other loans (like mortgages, car loans, student loans, and business loans) key off of it.

So when the yield goes up, it means the U.S. government has to pay more to borrow ‚Äî and so do you.

Higher yields = higher interest rates across the board.

That‚Äôs bad for:

‚Ä¢ Homebuyers ‚Äì higher mortgage rates = higher monthly payments

‚Ä¢ Businesses ‚Äì higher borrowing costs = harder to invest, hire, or expand

‚Ä¢ The government ‚Äì more of the federal budget goes toward interest payments instead of programs like schools or infrastructure

‚Ä¢ The stock market ‚Äì investors shift money out of stocks and into safe, high-yielding bonds, pushing stock prices down

Basically, because so many interest rates are tied to the 10-year Treasury yield, any increase in that yield raises the cost of capital for the entire economy. Getting money becomes more expensive. Business slows down. At the same time, stock prices drop.

It‚Äôs a double whammy.

That‚Äôs why people watch the health of the Treasury market so closely ‚Äî because it affects nearly everything in the economy, even if you don‚Äôt own a single bond yourself.","Imagine the U.S. government borrows money from people for 10 years and promises to pay them back with a bit of extra money (interest). That ‚Äúbit of extra‚Äù is called the yield. A Treasury is basically that. It‚Äôs an instrument where the government borrows money and agrees to pay back more after a period of time. So the 10-year Treasury is a loan the government will pay back in 10 years with a little extra.

Now let‚Äôs say I buy a Treasury for $10 and get $11 back from the government over 10 years. That‚Äôs a 10% return over its life, or about 0.96% annually if compounded, but roughly 1%/year if simplified. We call that a 1% yield.

Why does dumping bonds make the price go down? Simple supply and demand ‚Äî just like selling stocks makes their prices go down. If you suddenly sell a lot of anything, the price drops because supply overwhelms demand. Now, China has almost $800 billion in Treasuries (and they are also a big buyer, which creates demand). Japan holds even more ‚Äî about $1 trillion. That can move markets.

And remember, even if China holds only a small fraction of total outstanding Treasuries, what matters is the float ‚Äî that is, how much is being bought and sold at a given time. For example, say typically 1% of the houses in your city are on sale at any time. Now some real estate mogul decides to sell all his houses, which make up 2% of the housing stock. That‚Äôs a small fraction of all the homes in the city ‚Äî but it triples the supply that‚Äôs for sale. There aren‚Äôt enough buyers for that. So prices drop. A lot.

Even though it‚Äôs just a 2% change in total inventory, it‚Äôs a huge disruption to the normal market activity. Japan and China can flush the Treasury market in a similar way. If they sell a lot at once, there simply won‚Äôt be enough buyers ready with cash ‚Äî and that‚Äôs what we call a liquidity crunch or low-liquidity situation.  Since China is a big Treasury buyer, they can affect the demand side too by stopping their buying.  

Remember that bond that paid $11 that I bought for $10??  Now let‚Äôs say I sell that bond for $8 because someone is dumping bonds and prices are falling. That bond still pays $11 over its life. So the person who buys it from me is getting a $3 gain on an $8 investment ‚Äî or a 37.5% total return over 10 years. That translates into about 3.2% annually (compounded) ‚Äî a big jump from the original 1% yield!

So as you can see, as bond prices go down, yields go up ‚Äî they move inversely.
Now, the next time the government wants to borrow money, it can‚Äôt offer the old 1% yield anymore. Why? Because people can just go buy that 3.2% yielding bond on the open market. To compete, the government has to raise the interest rate on new bonds to match what the market is demanding. So it ends up paying more to borrow money.

Why Is This Important?

Because the 10-year Treasury yield is a benchmark ‚Äî many other loans (like mortgages, car loans, student loans, and business loans) key off of it.

So when the yield goes up, it means the U.S. government has to pay more to borrow ‚Äî and so do you.

Higher yields = higher interest rates across the board.

That‚Äôs bad for:

‚Ä¢ Homebuyers ‚Äì higher mortgage rates = higher monthly payments

‚Ä¢ Businesses ‚Äì higher borrowing costs = harder to invest, hire, or expand

‚Ä¢ The government ‚Äì more of the federal budget goes toward interest payments instead of programs like schools or infrastructure

‚Ä¢ The stock market ‚Äì investors shift money out of stocks and into safe, high-yielding bonds, pushing stock prices down

Basically, because so many interest rates are tied to the 10-year Treasury yield, any increase in that yield raises the cost of capital for the entire economy. Getting money becomes more expensive. Business slows down. At the same time, stock prices drop.

It‚Äôs a double whammy.

How well do you know international trade? This whole tariff debacle is about goods, because the US consumes wayyyy more goods than it produces. BUT. The US is a surplus
supplier in services. It is royally fucked if other countries start replacing US services with services from elsewhere. 

Americans so often believe the world needs them more than they need the world and it‚Äôs wild. It‚Äôs a truly interdependent system.
 
Also, one of the reasons the US has accepted higher tariffs on some goods until now is due to its favourable negotiations on the supply of services. 

Further, the reason for the 90 day tariff pause on some nations is due to other countries completely screwing your bond market, which will tank your economy faster than a trade war. China is one of those countries. For a country with much higher debt than most others, the US is incredibly susceptible to movements in the bond market; which makes it dependent on countries who hold bonds.

I understand the education system in America has been degraded over decades. But it‚Äôs so tiring coming on here and reading half ass ignorant comments. It‚Äôs ok to not understand this stuff. It‚Äôs not ok to just go ‚Äòbut murica is the best‚Äô. You‚Äôre not. You‚Äôre borderline third world at this point and the rest of the world is moving on without you.

If China imports anything from US it's mostly tech/services (as anyone else, that's why tariffs based on goods trade balance are just big xD).
