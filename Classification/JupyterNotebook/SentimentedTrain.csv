"Hello! How well do you know international trade? This whole tariff debacle is about goods, because the US consumes wayyyy more goods than it produces. BUT. The US is a surplus
supplier in services. It is royally fucked if other countries start replacing US services with services from elsewhere. 

Americans so often believe the world needs them more than they need the world and it’s wild. It’s a truly interdependent system.
 
Also, one of the reasons the US has accepted higher tariffs on some goods until now is due to its favourable negotiations on the supply of services. 

Further, the reason for the 90 day tariff pause on some nations is due to other countries completely screwing your bond market, which will tank your economy faster than a trade war. China is one of those countries. For a country with much higher debt than most others, the US is incredibly susceptible to movements in the bond market; which makes it dependent on countries who hold bonds.

I understand the education system in America has been degraded over decades. But it’s so tiring coming on here and reading half ass ignorant comments. It’s ok to not understand this stuff. It’s not ok to just go ‘but murica is the best’. You’re not. You’re borderline third world at this point and the rest of the world is moving on without you. Sort your shit out already.",-1.0

This was why he could not wait to boast about 'all these countries are calling and begging to kiss my a\*\*'.

China is a whole different ball game. The US depends on them much much more for a lot of the affordable day to day items Americans use and need.

Once thing Trump doesn't know is in Asia, there is a huge save face culture / cannot look weak.

**Time is against Trump. China will not make any attempt of communication until Trump backs down. He has to. THEY KNOW THIS.** Once basic day to day goods are not stocked / start rising in prices dramatically, people will get very very angry, including his supporter base.

Trump has to concede first by announcing the removal / significant reduction of tariffs. This will make him look like a pathetic, weak loser to his own country and to the world.

I guarantee you he is having sleepless nights at how calm and calculated the Chinese response is. Unlike others, there is no panicking. They are not rushing to have talks as he probably expected.

Trump is the epitome of the Republican Party, the most honest representation of the political far-right in living memory. That is why he is immensely popular, the more he destroys the US government, the happier the oligarchs and the Republican base is.

You have to figure that the GOP has been electing criminals for the past 80 years. Richard Nixon was first elected to Congress in 1947, was in the White House as VP in 1953, was nearly president in 1961, and both he and his VP from 1969 to 1974 occupied the White House. Instead of going to prison for life for their crimes, both the Republican president and vice president got to walk away scot-free. In 1973, the GOP engineered a coup to install another VP to become president to ensure that all future Republican government officials, all of similar criminal intent, are allowed free regain to never face any sort of criminal justice for their crimes.

It's kind of easy to see how Gerald Ford, a guy never voted into the White House, could be the worst US president in history. In the typical Republican gaslighting way, ""for the good of the people"" was the rallying cry to let these criminals, the highest elected officials in the land, walk away without life terms in prison. The exact opposite is true, and the US political center and so-called ""left"" as well as the world as a whole has been paying the price since.

In the immortal words of Michael Bolton (Office Space, 1999), had Spiro Agnew and Richard Nixon spent the rest of their lives in a ""federal pound-me-in-the-ass prison,"" the US would not have had this never-ending, long line of far-right-wing criminals in federal, state, and local government positions, fleecing and living off taxpayer dollars (and by extention other nations all across the globe).

But here we all are, living the Republican dream with the dream Republican president.

* **Russell Lake Project**: They're gearing up for a 5,000-metre diamond drilling program over the next few months. This is quite a large-scale operation, considering it'll cover ten to twelve holes. What's more, this project is strategically located near Cameco's McArthur River Uranium Mine.
* **Moore Uranium Project**: After wrapping up at Russell Lake, they're planning to drill an additional 3,000 meters in eight to ten holes at their wholly-owned Moore Project. The focus here is on high-grade uranium, which is pretty intriguing.

The combined drill campaign across both projects totals 8,000 metres and is fully funded. The company seems confident in the discovery potential at both sites, especially given the high-grade mineralization in historical drill holes.",1.0

What's ""historic"" is that we have a president who will repackage his gross negligence as  ""genius"",  a large swath of the public who believe whatever he says, a credulous media that enables him and a judiciary and majority party in the legislature that will give him cover no matter how destructive his actions are.
