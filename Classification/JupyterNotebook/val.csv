"I already have an account at Schwab, which is for long-term investing. Most of their trading is terrible, especially on the phone app. I moved everything but my cash before the migration, so the only thing there right now is my cash. Now that I have filed my taxes, I don't need that account at all. I will move the cash to my investment account. Schwab is fine for investment, but their response times in the app are horrible, so regular trading is impossible. ToS is available after your migration, but the new version of the app just doesn't respond very well, as though the server just can't handle the traffic. regular trading requires speed, and Schwab just doesn't seem to have it.",0

"Terrible company. They have no clue what they’re doing. Tried to transfer money and take my mother off the account after she passed away. Spoke to 6 people and they still didn’t get it right. My daughter was a beneficiary, they charged her to get the money out of a savings savings account. Then after finally getting the money, they wired 3 cents, which cost my daughter $15. A lot of better companies out there, why settle for a terrible company",0

"I hate that the new app is generically called ""desktop app"" because there are desktop and mobile versions of TWS so when I read someone talking about the desktop app my first thought is that they are talking about TWS desktop (as opposed to mobile)

Okay so the guy really doesn't understand what he's doing but that doesn't change the fact that thinkorswim act absolutely just sucks I have to do everything on swap.com off the watch list where yeah my spelling is bad but I'm doing voice to text so get over it but think or swim sucks,0
"So some of what you've said here isn't correct. 

As far as checks, you may or may not get them depending on the account types and how long you've had the checking set up on the td side. 

Ach stuff doesn't take 30 days to change over. You do need to start using the schwab checking info as soon as you get it, but there's a grace period. Checks from the td stuff will still be cashed up til June 12th. Afterward things will be rejected. Not sure when you were told 90 days, but that's inaccurate.  I'd suspect if you were told that if you were assigned to a previous transition group before being moved to the final wave. 

The td emails have been pretty clear that the only thing you could do is set up the login. Everything has said you can access Schwab as of Monday. 

The reps on the Schwab side are the wrong people to listen to about anything transition related. Most of them don't know.",0
"In my opinion, Fidelity and Charles Schwab are top tier.

I'm still with CS because thinkorswim keeps me there. There is a learning curve, but it's one of the best out there. Significantly better than Active Trader Pro, which is what I assume you were using with Fidelity.

Second recommendation might be Webull. The desktop trading platform is smooth and responsive, unlike the .NET framework of ATP and old java of TOS (thinkorswim).

Here is my rating list, if you are curious. TD Ameritrade would have been the only one in S tier, but they got bought out by CS. I have current accounts at all of these except for Tradestation (closed it out last year).

S Tier: Fidelity, Charles Schwab  
A Tier: Webull  
B Tier: Tradovate, TastyTrade, Tradestation  
C Tier: E\*Trade, Vanguard, Robinhood  
D Tier: IBKR, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Edge

Good luck!",0
"I almost moved to Schwab, but found out they don’t do fractional trading on ETFs. That’s a deal breaker for me. The UI/UX is horrendous with Vanguard. I’ve been with Fidelity for a very long time with a lot of money there; I just recently got caught up with these ridiculous holds. I pulled $1,000 over on 10/4; it finally cleared on 10/29. I’m trying to find a suitable alternative.",0
"Alright, let’s tone down the attitude and focus on the real issue. I fully understand that eToro has the right to decide where they operate and who they serve. But what I’m pointing out is how **an online platform**, which promotes global accessibility, can seriously screw over customers with how they handle situations like this.

Closing an account completely—without clear terms specifying how long someone is allowed to temporarily reside abroad—is how companies end up blindsiding or outright screwing their customers. A read-only restriction or some other less drastic option would have been a more reasonable approach. Instead, they chose the nuclear option, which feels like an overreach, especially since I’m not asking them to break laws or operate where they’re not licensed.

So no, it’s not hard for me to understand their right to operate as they choose—it’s hard to accept why anyone would defend such a tone-deaf way of handling customers. This is exactly how companies end up rear-ending people, and it’s not acceptable.",0
I can’t even check the cost basis in the app. You have to go through the website and it’s not even totally accurate or up to date. I hate Schwab so much. Email the Schwab executive your complaints. His address is somewhere on the thread.,0

"Yeah man I agree. I did an ACATs into IBKR, transferred 3000 and then I got a new job and had to buy a car but they wouldn’t let me pull the 3000. Called them on the phone and mic quality was awful and they weren’t very clear. I got a ticket response 1 day later stating it was the ACATs and why. It still doesn’t explain why my 3000 dollars had to be locked up as that wasn’t part of the ACATs",0
"Note that holding VFV in one brokerage and ZSP in another can trigger other issues around superficial loss.

https://financialpost.com/personal-finance/taxes/jamie-golombek-tax-loss-selling-in-july-dont-get-tripped-up-by-the-superficial-loss-rules

>One final caveat about the superficial loss rules in the context of identical properties and index funds or exchange-traded funds. In 2001, the CRA stated that, in its view, index funds from different financial institutions are considered to be identical properties if they track the same index (say, the S&P/TSX composite), so simply selling one index fund and replacing it with a similar one from another issuer could trigger the superficial loss rules if it hasn’t been at least 30 days.

Both VFV and ZSP track the S&P500, so selling one and buying the other within a 30-day period can prevent you from claiming capital losses. You'd have to use funds that track different indices, like VFV (S&P500) and VUN (S&P Total Market), to avoid this issue.",0

"Yeah. I get what people are saying, it makes sense that the net deposits would be across all accounts, but given that this promo has a specific registered investment angle, which are typically head for longer terms without withdrawls, I can understand why people like myself interpreted it differently given the long term holding nature of those investments.

During the last 1% promo, I had budgeted in a significant margin (ex: to buy a car, mortgage prepayment), working with a WS rep, so that my bonus would be calculated on a lesser amount. What I am curious is, if they are going to calculate the net balances across all my accounts at time of transfer in for the new promo, or in addition to the previous net threshold amount that I negotiated (and that shows up in the app). Not sure if this makes sense. I emailed the WS rep for clarity. If they were to remove my eligibility for the new promo, based on me withdrawing funds from my cash account (within the buffer of the original net proceeds), that would be very frustrating and I would definitely take my business elsewhere to take advantage of another institutions promos.",0
"Apologies if this question does not belong here but I am at the end of my tether!  

Condor Gold sold to Metals Exploration mid January and whilst I have been credited with the  cash  compensation of 9.9p per share I am yet to receive the Metals Exploration shares to my account. In fact, even though Condor Gold was delisted on the 14th January they are still showing on my IBKR account!

Despite complaining to IBKR that Metals Exploration shares should have been credited to accounts by now I just get the usual response that I simply must wait!  Its most likely my ignorance and that it does actually take 2 months for new takeover shares to be credited but the lack of customer support is driving me mad.

Can anyone shed any light please? is there any IBKR users who had Condor Gold in the same position? If its any use my Condor Gold shares were on the TSX as I could not buy them on the LSE.

  
Thanks!!!",0
Schwab is the most horrible platform. No issues with IBKR,0
I’m not sure why you would approach a Reddit group with this situation unless you are warning us that Fidelity will not support their customers given a very strange set of events. Get a lawyer as others have suggested.,0
"My CIBC accounts transferred within 2 weeks for an in-cash order. Sounds like you initiated the transfer over the holidays? Literally nothing moves from december 20th to the end of the year, transfers get rejected for made up reasons and things definitely go missing in back office.

So could be a multitude of things causing the delay, my guess is holidays and CIBC dropping the ball. Yet another reason to move to WS.",0
"I've always had issues with lag on ToS as well, I even set the settings to have more dedicated memory usage and I have 32Gb of RAM....it's a great platform if it didn't lag so badly.  I use Webull as well and that thing is smooth AF",0
"Been down this rabbit hole recently … unfortunately TOS scanners more or less don’t work pre market (from talking with live chat I don’t think it’s getting updated anytime soon and there is a delay on the data as well).  

If you add mark% change and mark price to scanner/watchlist it helps filter pre/post market still is not great (always missing info and including random anomalies like reverse splits and other bs)

Best solution IMO is pulling up YouTube on your monitor/phone/ipad whatever and watch zendoo channel live scanner… I’m pretty sure it’s exactly what your looking for and has only a 3 second stream delay… all momentum scanners(up and down) and halt information which is really helpful during market hours.  

I usually check it in the evening also and plan out potential runners to look for the following day by creating a watchlist in TOS from what looks good to me based on float volume news and load some into charts if they look good and maybe draw some TA lines… then I wake up and confirm or deny / update my stuff getting ready for the open.

GL hope this helps",0
"By the way, you aren't really earning interest when you invest in most ETFs like ZEQT. You earn dividends - that is the yield - which are payments made to shareholders from companies for performing well (usually). There is also a capital gain/loss, which is the difference between the share price when you sell compared to when you purchased.
Some ETFs like ZMMK and CASH.TO have distributions that are interest because they are like a high interest savings account. 
I mention this because account interest is considered safe - like a GIC, but the low risk means low reward.  Buying stocks can lead to losses or dividend cuts during market downturns (2008 financial crisis, covid, etc). The key is to NOT SELL so you don't realize the loss when this happens.  Wait it out so the value bounces back.",0
"yes, good advice on the push, but i’m talking about an HSA. the point of it is to pay medical bills. if your lucky and healthy enough to just let the money sit and grow, consider that a blessing. i’m not a young, healthy buck anymore and my family has medical expenses that have to be paid. 

the fidelity agent, of course, mentioned I can “simply” reimburse myself sometime in the future (after they institute a hold on transferring that money back to myself). it’s horseshit. no small amount of interest or dividends makes a hold like that reasonable in any sort of way. it should be criminal, but this is the great ol’ USA so f@&$ consumers.",0

"idk how but nicehash which also is pulling bull on us as of now is better than etoro, but I suggest everyone dump etoro, its a bs site full of insider traders, the only way to fight back against etoro is to make dogecoin worth 1000 dollars, then all the people holding 40k doge would see the assets go back into their wallet

More like a window to look through rather than being able to directly interact, its helped with my discipline as an investor!

"Not sure about that but trading CFDs on eToro will lead you to lose all the traded funds over time. When using CFD, you are betting against eToro. They set their system up in a way where this will happen. With pure abuse. Then they will direct you to their terms and conditions which make no clear statement of them being able to manipulate their platform to do so. So far, they get away with it sufficiently to make it a core part of their business model.

Most people find this hard to believe when it happens to them. Once it does, they get worn out by very streamlined, even if non intelligent, process run by their reps, which hand a client over to eachother continuously. Vast majority of people do not end up suing and they keep all relevant information on their end, so you are in adeliberately  exceptionally inferior position to take action. They then deploy shills, if you post on a public forum, who try to quickly stifle a discussion by insisting you must be a bad investor or a liar. 

This is their MO. I would advise against shorting, leveraging,.. on this platform. Due to this unaffiliated group having a rule to not divert users away from Etoro, a substantial chunk of criticism, regardless of how well founded, may get a post deleted. They also may disappear then from google searches, etc. Which is what eToro hopes for and also spends money on. It is not a neutral platform. They gain when you lose and lie about that to anyone asking this.",0

"I got completely scammed by Fidelity.  deposited a large check, paid my credit card bill + mortgage thinking the funds were settled - NOPE.  I got slammed with fees because my payments bounced due to insufficient funds, because Fidelity is locking up MY funds for a month because of THEIR inability to deal with tiktok scammers.  

The best part?  The check that they held for 21 days was issued by ... Fidelity.  Yup.  They had to hold my money for 21 days to make sure they didn't bounce a check to themselves.

I called them and spoke to multiple customer service agents, told them exactly how much I wanted them to pay me back for the extra fees I incurred because of the bounced payments, they refused.  

I am very seriously going to be pursuing legal action against them as an individual, and as a class action.

"""Push"" from the source bank side to Fidelity.  Don't pull from Fidelity.  Check deposits are considered a ""pull"".  Not always an option since banks can have stingy ACH transfer limits, but do it when possible.

I have noticed that I avoid the hold when the deposited check amount is a small percentage of the accounts total balance.  Depositing a $500 check into an account with a $2000 balance?  Hold.  $5000 check into an account with a $500k balance?  No hold.  So total amount of deposits doesn't matter as much as the account being deposited to.  That $500 check deposit is a small fraction of all of my Fidelity accounts, but if it goes into a small balance account, it gets a hold.

> It leads me to believe either their fraud problem is so bad that they don't care about alienating existing clients or their risk assessment process is completely broken.

These holds don't alienate me.  If I pull $50K into Fidelity, I get to use the funds immediately.  Even before the check clears.  I'm just restricted from withdrawing the funds.  If I wanted to withdraw the funds, why would I have put it into Fidelity in the first place?",0
"Agree to disagree. Even with the huge improvements they’ve made over the last year, it’s just not comparable to the ease of use or extra features you get from Webull, RH, Tasty, even ToS.

Anyway, I've just submitted another transfer request 5 mins ago and thought it is probably the end of it? Then I saw your thread and the £17 per position handling fee shenanigan ... sigh, Freetrade, do you really have to be this annoying?",0
Iyeah I can’t find them. I might have to just call them. I hate Schwab,0
"It's not been possible to contribute to more than one of the same kind of ISA before. This will change in April though, so I'm looking forward to it.

I avoid interest as much as possible at the moment because the allowance is low and I don't really want to pay the higher rate tax on anything above it. So I've been juggling it around as best as I can outside of that.",1
its the same with its desktop and TWS apps .. how the heck do these guys even claim they are better than robinhood or webull?,1
"This is pretty much what i have as well. But i have not had terrible experience at fidelity yet, so i am sticking there as well.",1
"Im here since the blip (april 2020). Zero issues withdrawaing, 0 issues with trade executions, 0 issues with pricing, 0 issues with support, etc. Etoro is a good broker, I would recommend.",1
"you can't just judge by trading fees, because the execution price would be different from platform to platform. Robinhood is PFOF(Payment for order flow). You should test it yourself to see which platform gives you the net overall better prices. a lot of times PFOF gets worse execution, but you must test for yourself.

For margin, for 300k margin here is the comparison I see:  
Robinhood  
5.75% for 50k + 5.55% for 50k + 5.25% for 200k = $16,125  
IBKR  
5.83% for 100k + 5.33% for 200k = $16,490  
so in terms of margin robinhood is $365 better. but to be fair robinhood gold costs $50 per year, so the savings is actually $315 better for robinhood.

IBKR has a lot of great features/order types/access to global markets etc. that robinhood doesn't have. As well as it is a safer broker.",1
Ideally there are no fees when you’re transacting in your accounts.  You can avoid this by sticking with Fidelity funds and others labeled as no transaction fee.  In general there aren’t many fees that you’d be paying and there is no standard monthly transaction fee for a self managed account,1
"Yeah, it's a third-party service, but it's legit. They basically help set up a live TOS account (for charting and scanning only) through a workaround. I was skeptical at first too, but I’ve been using it for a while now and it works just like you'd expect — real-time data, no delays, full access to tools. Definitely worth it if you're just using TOS for technical analysis.",1
"What are you talking about? What middle finger?

The company doesn't practice payment-for-order-flow and still tries to offer free transactions (to the average everyday investor). What more do you want? I think people should be a little bit more grateful. Before freetrade and trading212, each transaction was around £10 !!

They don't offer leverage and all the other lottery-inspired trinkets that US brokers offers consumers to shoot themselves with. 

I think 10 free shares are more than enough, and probably more reasonable given their size.",1
"Amazing they did not port TDA interface to stone-age Schwab app!

"Love it. Support takes a couple of days to respond, but you should never really need to message them. Deposits are quick. Buying power is given just as quickly. Withdraws can be done instantly at a small fee or ach within 1-3 days. I use it with a tradingview for a 'better' visual setup.",1
"I switched to TD Ameritrade from Robinhood, the new  Schwab is very disappointing.  We should all go to the Schwab forum and let them know.  I really don’t understand why they couldn’t just continue using the TD app on a revised setup.",1
Thanks! Does their basic brokerage include more passive options like index funds for free also in your experience?,1
"I'm with you on this. They've patient, informative, etc. etc. etc. whereas all the etc. are good things.

"Good morning,
I am a French citizen and resident in France. Here are the answers in order:

1/ Is it easy to use? Yes, very easy, I'm starting on the stock market and IBRK is my first broker. I don't regret my choice at all. For the slightly ""complex"" parts, I used tutorials on YouTube.

2/ Easy to finance your account? Yes very easy.

3/ Automatic form? I don't know the form you are talking about but I automatically received the forms for French residents (tax reduction in Ireland and tax reduction for investments in the USA).

4/ I defined my currency in euros. But you can change at any time + convert your currencies at any time without necessarily changing your base currency. Both are possible.

5/ As a French citizen (European Union), it is impossible to buy American ETFs which do not comply with UCITS regulations. So I buy SP 500 domiciled in Ireland and whose replication quality is superior to ETFs domiciled in the USA, because we are not reduced by the 15% US tax.

6/ IRA/ROTH? I don't know what this is about, sorry.

7/ Do I recommend? Yes, very much so. Much more than Trade Republic for example (in Germany)",1
"Yeah, you’re right—TOS (under Schwab now) used to have a bit of an edge on fees, but lately they’re pretty close to IB, especially for options. Schwab has $0 commission on stocks, but still charges $0.65 per options contract, which is pretty standard now.

That said, you don’t *have* to be locked into TOS for trading. A lot of traders stick with brokers like IB (for fills or global access) and just use **ThinkOrSwim for charting, analysis, scanning, and strategy work**. You can trade wherever fees and execution are best for you—and still keep all the tools ToS offers on the side.

[Here’s a guide if you want to set that up without a full Schwab trading account.](https://thinkorswim-europe.medium.com/how-to-get-a-real-thinkorswim-account-without-quotes-delays-for-non-us-residents-294b4722697f)

So yeah—pick the broker that works best for your trading, and use ToS for everything else.",1

"Looks like a lot of fake reviews from foreign countries (Wealthsimple is only available in Canada), always suggesting a different platform.  So spam reviews basically.

"No offense but if you can’t spend $40/yr for a 4.1%  rate, 3.5% ira match, reduced commissions and level 2 data transferring brokerages isn’t gonna do much for you. Lvl 2 data starts at $3/mo for the most basic package. 

My annual fee was covered in two days from the 4.1% and would have been covered in an hour if I transferred my IRA in. My IRA is currently with RH so I will be transferring it into Webull. I trade webull because of the UI so if you enjoy that part of it I would recommend staying. RH made me lose a lot more money on options slippage and auto liquidation of options at 3:30.",1
"I posted that before hoping that maybe they would restart the app. It really wouldn’t cost anything to do it and it would keep some old TD customers very happy. 
I will be leaving Schwab if they don’t bring it back because their watchlist was extraordinarily handy to use.",1
"Okay, I’ll give you my thoughts, I love TDA - their platforms, especially TOS and customer service too. If I have any cons it’s that they don’t do fractional shares. 
My accounts haven’t yet migrated to Schwab, but I did open a Schwab account essentially to test it out, since they were offering a promo for new accounts. Their platform is meh, but they allow for fractional shares, which makes investing the same amount each month easy, so that’s a pro. Customer service at Schwab is decent- although people here have shared here that they’ve been less than happy with their experience, that has not been my experience. I’ve had an easy time resolving issues w/them. Another pro. I’ll likely stick with schwab mostly because TOS will still be available.
TDA is far superior to active trade. Some of my friends who’s accounts migrated from TDA have lost access to TOS- they’ve been told they’ll have access eventually…

Have you tried reaching out to fidelity sub here? They are very prompt and helpful.",1
"Here are the services that I cannot find in webull but ibkr has, bond(tbill), fx pair trading, event betting, currency conversion, portfolio margin, and prime broker.

For product features, webull has the surface area for retail traders, but not for robust & high value traders, they are lack behind. For example, a covered call in ibkr can be done in 1 order(long 100 shares + short call), but I try around in webull, I can't seem to find that. In addition to that, webull didn't offer portfolio margin or prime broker account to high value traders. Could be webull's target audiences are retail traders, but not the high value day traders.

Overall, I say webull is a great broker and have many great tools, and improvements on products and features still needed, especially on for those high value clients' features.",1
The Fidelity options are excellent - great user interface too. (I don't work for them - just a fan.) Best wishes - hope you have fun things to spend it on in 20 years!,1
"Love Freetrade and have my ISA with them, just really wish Limit Orders and Stop Losses came as standard. I understand Freetrade is designed towards long term investing but do feel these are pretty basic trading features to lock behind Plus. 

Saying that I have considered jumping to Plus for the extra stocks and 3% interest as well as unlocking those extra features!",1
"Just had my brokerage account moved to Schwab.  I considered myself a ""power user"" of the TD Ameritrade website.   Unfortunately, the first trading day on Schwab today was....rough.   LOTS of little things missing on Schwab that I took for granted on the TD site.   However, the trades themselves went smoothly and without issue.

I just don't understand why they ditched the superior website.  Corporation logic at it's finest...

Thankfully, Think or Swim is coming to Schwab ""later this year"".   I was never a power user of Think or Swim....but I think I will give it a shot once it arrives on Schwab.",1

My opinion is it is decent has a lot of things there but not like TOS. SSE has lagged a lot for me but been fine other than that which shouldn’t happen. Their mobile app is missing a lot of things. I still don’t get why people don’t think schwab has a lot of cons even though they are a decent main broker. They’ve been going down hill for about 1.5-2 years now IMO.,1
"Spot-on. Let's also face facts that the average retail user who isn't looking to trade often is going to find TOS too complex with too high a learning curve. The TD app is far more intuitive, too, and losing that is going to seriously hurt someone trying to get accustomed to Schwab's garbage or feeling forced to try to like TOS.",1
"Robinhood hired a bunch of TDA people after Schwab acquired TDA. I like TDA, Schwab, Fidelity, and Vanguard for different purposes, but Robinhood is the best now. It has the best app, 1% match on 401k and IRA transfers/contributions, better trade execution than Interactive Brokers (according to a UC-Irvine study), 24/5 trading on individual stocks, commission free stock, options, and crypto trades, and a much less scammy business model than Schwab (in my opinion). 

Special note: Fidelity's app is one of the worst apps I've ever used. They've tried to copy Robinhood and it's been a disaster for several years now.

"I would love to share your optimism.

Freetrade does charge for services, Freetrade Plus, ISA, SIPP. That is their model, give the basic for free charge subscription fees for additional stuff. If that isn't working lending out shares that don't belong to them isn't in retail investors best interest.

Freetrade doesn't hold your shares they are held by a custodian, yes they are regulated by UK / US regulators respectively, however neither Freetrade nor Drivewealth (whom Freetrade ""buy"" US shares), can give me evidence my shares have been brought. They can only say if the app says it has then it has. No note of who the share was brought from, no ability to transfer the share without cashing it out. It is in an account held by a custodian which I cannot access or even view. I can only see what the app shows me with no way to verify. If they offered in specie transfers (transfers without having to sell the shares for cash and transferring the cashing), or if they allowed direct registration rather than a custodial account, then I might have more faith they own the shares I have brought. Until then I can only hope they aren't IOUs.",1

"The ability to do most all of your financial tasks at one place is appealing. I like that Fidelity will auto sell a money market fund if it’s needed to fund a stock purchase. At Schwab, that is not the case. The Fidelity web and app user experience is easy to understand after using it for a few weeks. Anyone will feel some frustration changing to a different platform as it’s unfamiliar. I find Fidelity to be one of the better designs. I appreciate how they integrate quickly and easily with most local banks if you want to push/pull money. Fidelity uses electronic signatures for most account setups. They have many low fee or no fee options for investing. If you’re a low-cost index investor, the fees are the same between any of the brokerages; it comes down to user experience and customer service experience. I also like how they have responded to feedback and suggestions I’ve made over the years. They called me a week after making a suggestion to fully understand what I was asking for on their platform. They were very responsive. When a relative passed away and I was tasked with handling their estate, Fidelity did a good job walking me through what needed to be done and it went smoothly.

Their education series, webinars, videos, and guides are all well done. They have monthly education that you can watch live or a replay on topics of interest. For people with a decent level of assets, you’ll have access to a local Fidelity representative. Mine is a CFP with other additional credentials. They have helped me think through some financial paths and estate planning. They would probably like it if I asked them to manage my accounts, but have never pushed it, only mentioned it. We meet a couple times a year at their local office or over video chat.

A couple suggestions. Open a brokerage account and skip the cash management account. Brokerage account will pay more on uninvested cash sitting in the account by a percentage point or two. Read about the differences (it’s been posted numerous times on Reddit). Cash Management Account helps some people by reimbursing ATM fees, where you have to have more assets in the brokerage account to get the same benefit. If starting all over, I’d skip the CMA and just do a brokerage account with Fidelity. You could some money over and use their platform for a few weeks to be sure you’re comfortable before moving it all.

Best wishes for a successful investing journey.",1

"This is absolutely incorrect and I have never experienced this issue on any other trade platform besides WealthSimple. The basis is actually pretty straightforward:

\- There are two spouses with RRSPs, one is an individual RRSP with one contributor and the same contributor is the same annuitant of the individual RRSP.  
\- The other spouse has a spousal RRSP, where they are the annuitant and both their spouse and themselves are the contributor. Effectively, this RRSP has two contributors.  
\- For math's sake, let's say each spouse is able to contribute $10,000/year to their RRSPs.  
\- Spouse 1, with the individual RRSP, contributes $5,000 to their individual RRSP. They then contribute $5,000 to the spouse's RRSP as the contributor, which is *deducted from their total contribution allotment*. Spouse 1 no longer has any funds to contribute to either RRSP.  
\- Spouse 2 contributes their full $10,000 to their spousal RRSP, noted in the contribution that the annuitant is the contributor, not the spouse. This spouse has effectively had $15,000 contributed to their RRSP, while the first spouse has had $5,000 contributed to theirs. ***Only the annuitant is able to take money from this spousal RRSP, and there has been no ""double-dipping"" in this instance***.

In this exact scenario it doesn't make sense as the amounts are equal, but in real life the first spouse would make more money than the second spouse, therefore having a higher RRSP contribution limit. Let's say spouse 1 can contribute $20,000 and spouse 2 can contribute $10,000. Spouse 1 puts $15,000 in their account, and $5,000 in the spousal account as contributor. Spouse 2 puts $10,000 in the spousal account as contributor. Effectively, while both contribution limits have been used up, each spouse now has an equal $15,000 amount in their RRSPs to pull from in retirement. It makes for equal income pulling and reduced incoming taxes in retirement where one spouse makes more than the other during their employment years.

**This is the whole purpose of a Spousal RRSP, so the two spouses have relatively equal RRSPs in retirement, in order to have equal retirement income, even though they had an income disparity while employed.** While not allowing the annuitant to contribute to the spousal RRSP doesn't *completely* nullify the whole purpose of it, as the annuitant can still contribute to their own individual RRSP if they want and eventually pull from 2 RRSPs in the future, it might as well be pointless now because what's the point of having two accounts to pull from... it's just a pain in the ass. Again, **I have never had this issue with any other institution using a Spousal RRSP. It is only WealthSimple.**",0

"I would like to make an update to this post for the sake of fairness.

Plus500 offer the price of the current future's market. At the time of this post in January 2022, the current futures contract is for February. The tradingview image posted is the spot price market and reflects current prices while future prices are not the same thing.

With this said, the futures market that Plus500 show is still not entirely the same as the future markets it is meant to reflect (when it comes to commodities). The moving averages are still in the wrong places and candle formation is still different. Therefore, I think the point remains that commodity trading on Plus500 is a no go.

When US stocks did poorly, so did international stocks. When US stocks had a good year, international had a better year as well.  I would ditch foreign stocks and go 100 percent into the S&P 500.  Historically, small cap value has performed well.  Yet, the last 10 years’ small cap value and small caps in general have far underperformed the S&P 500.  This is why total market index funds like the Vanguard total Stock market, the S&P 1500, and the Russel 3000 have underperformed the S&P 500.

> Personally, I think they're expecting a crash and are afraid of everyone selling (non-meme stocks) and pulling their cash - which would force them into liquidation.

People selling would not force them into liquidation, company operating funds are segregated from client assets. If anything, they'd gain more revenue from FX fees.

>The fact that FSCS only guarantees security on £85k of assets is concerning. If your assets are frozen, three months is a long period of time to have to wait - a lot can happen.

FSCS protects you from bank failures, fraud etc - you're not protected from AML regulations. Again, though, irrelevant due to client asset segregation.

>If you're buying any shares, I'd recommend only buying them in your name from the official broker of the company (ie. Computershare). That's the only guarantee your assets will be secure.

They give some reasons about *why* it's not going to be on time (they're busy addressing the fraud thing, they're changing the bank they use in the backend, other people signed up too much so there's a backlog), but at the end of the day what matters is:

**you're not gonna get your debit card anytime soon and they're giving people the runaround about it**

  
And for some accounts, all deposits into the money account have a **16 business-day delay before the money can be withdrawn or used for BillPay**, which they also haven't been clearly telling people about, while some accounts only have the 16 day delay for ACH pull transactions, but ACH push ones should have been faster. 

Which is frustrating and makes it hard to use for BillPay because 16 business days is 21 calendar days. So some people have been having trouble getting their bills paid on time, because that $5k deposit made on the 25th or whatever can't pay bills due on the 1st.",0
"It seems you are misleading here or mixing things or  got a bad explanation from their support. I read this in their help center and also experienced this myself in my account - 
eToro has 2FA with OTP (one-time password) via 3 channels: SMS, Phone and Push.

Push will work only after you will login with 2FA via SMS/Phone (not only credentials) on the Mobile App. Once it’s done, future 2FAs will be sent via Push, and the which is more secured then SMS (you are not exposed to SIM swap attacks etc.). From that point, your mobile app will get push (make sure you enabled Push notifications on your device). Try this and see it should work (try to login form desktop and you will get push to the mobile with OTP).

It’s indeed true that eToro is not offering an Authenticator app as a 2FA method / channel. I’ve also contacted their support on that and they advised it will be added at some point… let’s wait and see…

"VOO and FXAIX are essentially the same (both are S&P 500 index funds), but FXAIX has slightly lower expenses so I would go with FXAIX, all the more so because you'll be holding a Fidelity fund in your Fidelity account.

That said, the market is at an all-time high right now, and even up sharply again today after yesterday's election.   I'd maybe wait a few days or maybe put in $2,000, and then $2,000 more next week and keep incrementally moving more into FXAIX to avoid putting it all in at what might be an upward spike.

"**Past performance isn't indicative of future performance**, however, a quick google search has J&J with only a 1.05% increase over the last five years... to me that's pretty poor growth over a 5-year period 🤷‍♀️ I'd probably be looking into reasons why that may be so that I had the full picture before committing (i.e., is there a competing company that's stealing potential profits from them? Any on going legal battles that have had impacts (talc powder allegations/financial settlements etc.) do you prefer potential steady growth over potential explosive growth?)

When investing in individual stocks, it's also important to be mindful of world politics / current climates of the world - your plan is to invest for 5-years, well, these are US companies and Trump is presumably going to be in power for at least 4 of those years, and given how gung-ho he seems to be on tariffs (or just the complete lack of predictability from him) you need to consider whether his impact may impact you and any potential stocks you may invest in...

Personally, since you say you're new I'd just whack your 5-year plan in an all-world ETF - it's largely US companies anyway so you'd be marginally investing in the stocks you've got there already, whilst being backed up by the rest of the world so to speak. So if Trump does what Trump does best and causes problems in the US, your loss may potentially be offset a little/you wouldn't be hit *as hard* because via the all-world ETF you've been investing in other countries at the same time...

Honestly, investing in individual stocks is the biggest risk imo, especially if you don't know what you're doing. If you *genuinely* want to invest in individual stocks you really need to do your due diligence. That means taking an interest in quarterly reports/financials, reading up on company prospects, keeping up to date with what's being published about them etc. and really being aware of global politics and having a clear understanding of how **everything** can impact the companies you've got money in.

And even after doing that / continuously keeping yourself in the loop, remember, **you still know nothing**.

"I do. Originally when I started out investing more than 10 years ago, when there was less localised investing advice, and cheap online brokerages (and VWRA) weren’t a thing yet, I invested in unit trusts at roughly 25% US, 25% Europe, 25% Asia, 25% SG. 

Over time, the US portfolio grew the most, Europe not too far behind, Asia and SG lagged by a lot. Of course I didn’t keep sticking to the same allocation over the years. The SG unit trust (it is designed to give stable monthly dividends but I have it set up to reinvest automatically) is now under 10% of my portfolio. But I like how it has been relatively stable over the years e.g. in 2022 S&P500 went down 18%, the SG side went up a smidge, and seeing the constant dividends I will likely increase my allocation to it when I retire. 

I have recently started dabbling in SG stocks directly. Have to say that individual stocks are rather volatile and I can’t resist trading them. With the lot size of 100, fees, and volatility, I think accumulating lots of individual SG stocks is not for me. The unit trust with monthly dividends will be way less stressful to manage.",0

The bickering about accumulating and distributing classes is just bickering for lazy weekenders. I take the hard cash and set the limit order below the noise of the XD fall and get more shares for my money than you would get from the Co. deciding what price to buy at. I just posted a link to a UK site that ranks ETFs & ITs by dividend yield https://www.dividenddata.co.uk/ ,0
A call to ibkr seems the best action to find remedy and or answers,0
"I got my answer by just trying it out. The **Quantity** field on Merrill Edge website actually represents ""**Total Order Amount**"" with a minimum number of 1000 on the screen in the original post. So if you want to buy $5K in CDs, you put 5000 in that field. It doesn't multiply it by a 1000 as written in the Help text.

The user interface is confusing and poorly designed, and in multiple locations on the Merrill Edge website, they use the word ""quantity"" to represent ""amount""!

&#x200B;

EDIT:

I have both Fidelity and Merrill Edge accounts and the Fidelity website is much better for Fixed Income (CDs, Treasuries, etc.) with a much larger selection, new issues and secondary market, and being able to research and put in orders on the weekends (while Merrill Edge only allows this when the bond market is open). I have Merrill Edge just for the BoA Preferred Rewards tier.",0
"… and 2.0% cash back becomes 3.5% (unlimited) on their Premium Rewards card on travel+dining. Even with modest travel/dining spend, the $99 annual fee is worth it, especially when considering the airline incidental and TSA+ reimbursement. The travel+dining category is really liberal too, includes everything from airplanes to parking garages to hotel to campsites.",0
You’re welcome mate. IBKR has a decent paper account option which is great to get a feel for it and try out some strategies,1
It was first time on.  I was just looking for help.   The Schwab  chat guys could not help.   I do lots of covered calls (none for the last three weeks).   Last week would have been good.  Thanks again.,0
"They need to improve the holdings view. At least in the web. I love how Questrade has it all in the same row. Ticker, shares, Avg cost, Market price, Market value, P/L. Its so easier to just view the list of holdings and get all this information without clicking on the holding. In WealthSimple web, I need to click on the holding in order to get this information and then go back and click on another holding and so on.",0
Will you have an adjusted cost base tracker available for us to manually track cost cases for assets outside Wealthsimple? Like a smooth and clean and easier version of adjustedcostbase.ca,1
"Haha I honestly doubt the stock is going to go down purely because of that. At most it might possibly put some people off from buying it in the first place?  
  
I have tweeted Freetrade about it though because honestly it's not very professional either way and it's not something I'd expect from them as both a consumer and an investor.",0
"I have both.  Overall I do greatly prefer Fidelity however there are a couple of things I think are better at Merrill (though not many).

1.  Merrill has access to Institutional Money Market Funds for Blackrock and Fidelity.  This means I can invest in a Fidelity Money Market Fund for as little as $1 in my Merrill account that would require a $1 million minimum purchase directly in Fidelity.  

  
2.  Some of the research available in Merrill is better than what is available in Fidelity.  

  
With those 2 things said.  Overall I do much prefer Fidelity and park just enough VTI in Merrill to get preferred honors status.",1
"You will only incur capital gains tax if you sell something with a gain. I think they will just shut off Guilded investments and you will have the holding with the ability to sell them if you want. They may make a transfer of all holdings to a self directed account. This will not cost you anything. 

I have not used Guilded Investments, but did switch from  a wealth management advisor to Merrill Edge. It was pain free change, although it took a few days. No fees and all holdings transfered.",1

"I run the M4 base model coming from a M2 Pro and it runs rock solid. Just make sure you install the ""Apple Silicon"" version. TWS is is clunky anyway, but has nothing to do with Mac, as it runs the same on a high-end PC. Actually feels a little more snappier than the Windows version. Set it up for 4 GB memory in settings. Doesn't even go over 2GB. Depends on your setup of course.

As much as possible, avoid running software with the Rosetta emulator. Sometimes you have no choice, but most major software seems to be ported over to Apple Silicon.",0

"I've been very critical of Schwab reps and the trading platform in general, and I've already consolidated some of my accounts at Fidelity. But credit where credit is due. I had a very good experience with a Schwab rep on Friday concerning setup and activation of ToS on my trading account. He was polite, helpful, and walked me through the process, submitted a request to have ToS enabled for me, and said it would be up and running on Monday. In fact, ToS was ready to use on Sunday morning. I ha d a second interaction about checks for one of my accounts that should have arrived two weeks ago. That's obviously not his fault, and he looked into it, gave me an update, and assured me the check would arrive this week, and if not, call back and they'll deal with it. Perhaps things will begin to normalize as time goes by.",1
"Well, it's been a month and there are lots of issues. For example, I have a cash account but Schwab lets me spend way beyond the balance then tells me the next day that they'll restrict me to only settled cash if I do it again. TDA never let me go beyond my balance on the cash account. As a scalper, I don't have time to calculate what's left second by second. I go until the broker tells me I'm done. Never a problem in 15 years with TDA. Schwab immediately a problem.

My opening balance is always the opening balance from the previous day thus all transactions show a running balance that's false. No one seems to be able to fix it. They wanted to remote in to see for themselves (like they can't see it on their end). I let them and wow, it is wrong! So, they'll send some note to someone somewhere and . . . forget it.

I had a .62 buystop set on an OTO and it filled @ .96! Seriously??? .34 slippage! Never, ever in 15 years @ TDA did I get more than a few cents. The OTO converted to an OCO with a stop .10 down and profits @ .10 and .20 up. The price went to 1.34 with no fills. Then it turned and crashed to under .50. My stops supposedly triggered at .64 and .65. Customer services sucks. They told me at their end they can tell me ""millisecond by millisecond"" how the trade went and that it didn't reach the exchange until it was already at .75. Lies. It was placed 47 seconds before the move even began. And even if it was already .75, where was the sellstop .10 and .20 later? All that should have triggered for profit, not loss. They refused to credit anything.

THIS WAS A DOWNGRADE for sure. TIME TO ABANDON CS.",1
"Yup. They do the calculation as ALL WS assets + transfer balance = Qualified amount. If you take out 5% of trasnfer balance, against your qaulified amount, it starts being affected. Its a gatcha thing after I read the TOS and was trying to understand if moving it around would affect it (it didnt), but it effectively holds your non associated to the promo funds hostage.

  
So original balance is 100k. You transfer in 100k. Qualified balance is 200k. 5% of 100k is 5k. You take out 200-10 = 190k. You now get \~90% of the match (i dont actually know, but its likely close. I stopped looking into it as it made my head hurt)",0
Thats why i went with them they seem like a good bunch but i think i may swap to a more establisher broker later this year.,1
"Can you please explain why bank wires take 1-3 business days?  The entire point (and extra fee) for a wire is processing time no more than a handful of hours. No US bank processes wires that slowly; 1-3 business days is the standard ACH processing time for US banks, which is why I am confused.

Can you explain where the discrepancy comes from? I've come across other retail trading apps that use customer cash to meet the requirements under SEA Rule 15c3-3 to take on more debt. Is this what Moomoo does as well? Meaning the 1-3 business days for a wire indicates that how long it takes Moomoo to unwind customer funds from the omnibus account they are used in?

The timelines don't change when you explicitly revoke consent for Moomoo to take any custodianship by opting out of the cash sweep program either. Can you offer any transparency?",0
It’s an order type exclusive to Schwab where you can place a beginning price and an end price. The platform then walks your order beginning to end until you get filled. You decide the time and price intervals. It’s insanely good.,1
"I like Webull because every month I get to get back some ""reimbursement"" when u done >100  option trading as in the 0%commission fee",1
Have you subscribed to Webull L2 NBBO?  That is the National Best Bid and Offer ($9 a month). You do that then set your turbo trading and trading feed that that L2 (in the website app). You do that and your bid and asks trades are based on those feeds which offer a more realistic and current true numbers for the bid and ask as the free version is only based on Nasdaq numbers which can be multiple cents off. I have my offset at .02 and don’t really have problems at all. I typically get filled fairly quickly. Take a look and try it out. If you have more questions feel free to ask in this discord (https://discord.gg/njYmBbMP) . Not mine and I don’t work for it but I am a member and it has a free trial without cc. At the least you can ask questions and get some info during the trial that might help. Hope this info helps.,1
"Ultimately it depends on what you're looking for. Brokerages such as Schwab and Fidelity may be a little bit behind in terms of technology, but they have rock solid customer service and are constantly working to keep up technology wise.

If you prefer a fintech such as M1 Finance to get the more advanced tech and portfolio management, you lose out on that customer service and reputation of a brokerage that's been around for a long time.",1
"what you exact order was and where was DATS trading at the time.  Schwab rejects orders that don't make sense, could be that yours didn't according to their algorithm.   Its best to call the trade desk rather than post on Reddit if you really want the right answer.  They can actually tell you by looking at the trade.",1
"Took me awhile to figure out what you are doing. 

You will sell the condo and move back into the HDB, so there will be no more rental income. And you have correctly excluded the HDB property value that you will be living in from your total, for the purposes of FIRE.

It would have been clearer to express the sales proceeds of your condo minus outstanding loan, which becomes investible cash? Basically you will have existing $350K investments plus $450K investible cash, and your wife will have $450 investible cash. I'm neglecting fees associated with the sale, HDB reno and moving etc, but you should probably budget that in.

So together, you have 1.25M investible money. There might be some complication of having to pay back your CPF OA and accrued interest, but we can assume that you will be able to invest the CPF OA in Amundi Index MSCI World or whatever so it can grow in there. 

Whatever is in your SA, you can consider as extra backup. I personally would not consider MA as part of my FIRE number as medical expenses will increase in age (which isn't accounted for in your current expenses) and you will slowly deplete your MA. 

You can also count SA as part of the 50% bonds component of the 50-50 portfolio that SWR framework is based on. 

If you have already set aside your kid's uni fees (excluded from this table), then I think you are ok to FIRE, keeping a careful eye on expenses. 

Do have a closer look at 1) what needs to go back into CPF after selling the condo, and 2) costs associated with selling and moving. Your money outside of OA and SRS needs to be substantial enough that you can safely draw down on it from now until age 55.",1
"Banks in my country are absolutely terrible, no interest and no cashback. All they do is take a fee when you transfer money between banks.
 
So for me it makes _a lot_ of sense to use the T212 card, and with the new spending pot it makes even more sense and it's safer.",0
"Why? You can transfer a RRSP between institutions without going via a chequing account.


You probably just lost yourself that RRSP contribution room permanently and will likely only get the withholding taxes back when you do your 2025 taxes.


You could contact Wealthsimple and ask them to reverse the transaction, but they aren't really obligated to cater to your indecisiveness.",1
"TOS margin requirements are really high since they are a full service broker.   
I trade primarily on prop firms and Sierra is great for routing through Rithmic through propfirms.

I only pay for level 2 data on Sierra, and have a fairly inexpensive package on Tradovate.",1
"When I topped up etoro through Revolut by doing an USD transfer, there were no fees.

When I did it through a local bank and not revolut, there was a 35 dollars fee taken by the intermediary banks.

Maybe withdrawing through Revolut shouldn't take any fees, it depends on the routing that Etoro will have for the transfer through Revolut.

Try once, see how it goes. If there are fees, then next time just exchange it to eur/gbp on etoro and withdraw it through etoro money.

Good luck",1
"It wouldn't surprise me, but you'd have to track many transactions to confirm. I've seen Schwab screw up cybertrader, optionsxpress and now they have tos where it looks like they will ""leave it alone"" which probably means no feature improvements. Schwab buys out competitors for the customers not the technology. The Schwab platform has always been 2nd tier. As you all probably know, but just in case you don't, the market makers shave points to pay for lack of commissions now. How they do it is algorithmic so it can probably vary a cent or two.",0
Yes the other scan filters are native to TOS. You can use the scan wizard to find them. The Education tab has some great videos and tutorials on using the scanner.,1
"For the amount I have invested there, it is an absolute bargain. I’d easily be paying 10x fees at a broker like Hargreaves Lansdown. And there is an argument that somewhere like Trading212 is unsustainably cheap. Overall I’m plenty happy",1
"The lengthy deposit times in Canada is awful; as a small/newer investor just putting in small amounts (ive tried as low as $100) it takes 4 business days to become available or 1-2 days with large bank fees attached.  I recently switched over from Wealthsimple, debating switching back or looking elsewhere just to have the instant deposits available again, 4 days is kind of a joke and might be a deal breaker",0
"UPDATE:  
After 20 minutes in an online chat with the trade desk at Schwab, and after them trying to send me to the same places as the suggestions here, it was determined that this feature is locked within the program.  That is odd to me because nearly everything else is adjustable to some degree within TOS.  
The support guy, David, suggested a login to the web version of TOS and provide feedback through a link at the top of the homepage, but that doesn't create a support ""ticket"" or ""order"" of any kind, only provides a suggestion to the development team that someone is interested in being able to set the default ""WIDTH"" of a Trailstop order ticket so they don't have to change it manually each time it pops up.  
Perhaps, I'll fool around with a Template and see how it works, but running through the process in my mind tells me that it's going to be nearly as cumbersome as changing it in the ticket itself.",0
"From what I am hearing, WeBull and TastyTrade and IBRK are all Java based and I have no issues running them with the same number of windows and charts and indicators all at the same time. I love ToS!!! She’s my girl until she gives me no choice, but to leave her.",1
"I have both. I love thinkorswim. I find using schwab for trading clunky and slow, but it's possible I'm not configured correctly. Td app/website is between those 2 extremes.",0
"DO NOT GO TO ALLY!  I spent years frustrated with their poor customer service and lack of user friendliness before switching several accounts over to Fidelity. 

As others have said, Fidelity does not have HYSA. But I’ve found SPAXX to be just as good. And they have other useful products: brokerage, checking, 401K, Charitable DAF, etc. While not perfect, I’ve found them better than average for many banking needs.",1
"I moved to Fidelity. When I first selected a brokerage after a bit of research my first pick was TD, followed by Fidelity, then Schwab. I already had some accounts at Fidelity and figured it made sense to move the account than be forced into my third pick. I’m sure Schwab will be fine; I just wanted to consolidate and simplify things. 

I went through a similar account change when USAA sold its brokerage to Victory Capital. I left things there for a year or so before I decided to move the account. I probably would have taken that account to TD, but they didn’t have a few of the funds I was in, so that one ended up at Fidelity. Pretty sure I can still long into my closed Victory account after more than a year and access my old statements and transaction history. I was really surprised TD would lock up account access before the money was even transferred given how much they push electronic statements and documents.",1
"A few hours later, I got an automated email from Fidelity saying my billpay was canceled, so I called back to inquire and they said there was now a fraud restriction on the account probably due to the cancelled transfers (that Fid themselves recommended due to the circumstances and themselves cancelled).  I called back the next morning and spoke to a fraud services rep for an hour, who went thoroughly through my account, asked lots of questions, and told me not to worry, that they saw their system put an automatic flag on my account due to the transfers they canceled. They asked why I'd had so many ACH transfers lately and I explained that I'd had to scramble to move money because of their new 21+ day funds settling policy (and because I was just about to go out of town), otherwise my bills that come out of that account would have bounced. After an hour, the rep assured me that everything was ""good to go"" and that my account was ""all good"" and he removed the fraud flag. When I try to use my ATM card a few days later, it declines, and when I called in after the hurricane desperately needing to access my cash, Fid told me all of my accounts have been closed and they are not able to give any reason. To this day, they have yet to inform me of the account closures in any way - letter, email, or phone - other than me just calling in myself and them telling me they decided to close the accounts and that they do not have to tell me the reason. So I have been stuck in a catastrophic disaster without power for 14 days trying to deal with Fid who locked up my funds and closed my accounts without informing me. Unfortunately, my experience with Fidelity has turned from 98% positive into 100% negative. Be warned!",0
"Personally I’d avoid eToro, I had an account but closed it and got out. Their platform is “ok”, does the job but their customer service is an absolute joke. They don’t respond to tickets, they fob you off, their social media replies are just for show, you raise a complaint and they just close it without responding. I left not because of the platform, fees or anything like that. I left because I wouldn’t trust my money with a company that doesn’t respond to customers, and when they do, they just fob you off.",0
"I’ve been telling people that for years; maintain a good relationship with a bank.  That those relationships are invaluable.  I’ve faulted Fidelity with overselling services and promises.  But everything in one place appealed to the less financially sophisticated.  And now this.  Fidelity is largely silent because they have exposure here.  But at the same time, the barrage of crime everywhere posts is reminiscent of another largely financially less sophisticated meme stock bunch whining about removing the Buy Button and waiting for MOASS.  🤷‍♂️",0
"If you want to input code into an order ticket and have the order execute based on that code, for example an MA crossover… yes Thinkorswim can do that. All of my trades are triggered with code.
Thinkorswim has its limitations compared to other software for automated trading, but you can trigger an order or group of orders based off almost any study condition you can imagine. There’s some things other software can do by default that requires a bit of working around.

But if you’re looking to simply have buy and sell orders triggered by code/studies etc.

Thinkorswim can easily and absolutely, 100% do that.",1

For example, Ally Bank had a freakout about my identity.  They won't tell me what happened, just that the 3rd party system they (and a lot of banks according to them) decided there is a problem.  And no one can do anything about.  I solved that problem by moving my financial hub to a Fidelity CMA, but when the system can shut you down and there is no way to tell it that it made a mistake, it is a mess.",0

"ya, wtf.  its not accepting my TD login.  so the login prompt says ""if you already have a schwab account, maybe you need to try that"".  so i did.


 so i went over and tried my schwab login.   that worked.  however, now the program ONLY pulled up my schwab accounts.  however, they all say ""this account is not authorized to trade in thinkorswim"".

so i click and try to follow the guide to 'enable trading in think or swim"", and that doesn't work.

edit: nope.  this did not help me.  i was able to find the gear and exact thing you mentioned, but it did not work for me.  it would seem my TD account is completely un-accessible through think or swim.  thankfully i don't need to make any big changes in my account and will be working from home tomorrow.

edit2:  ok, very odd.  i tried the steps that OP menteioned again.  i wanted to get the error, and the phone number to call.  but.....this time they worked.  i was able to log into my TD account on think or swim, can see all the positons just like before, etc.  

i will admit, the only other things i had done last night.
- logged into schwab account (wasn't able to do anything), logged out
- logged into ""paper money schwab account"" (didn't do anything, so i logged out)
- logged back into live, schwab account, didn't do anything, logged out

Like I said in a previous comment, Freetrade themselves aren't going to be paying us our gains on any stock. It's the job of their execution venues to chase that up.

"I love ThinnkirSwim so I plan on staying with TDA/Schwab, at least minimally.  Why?  Because I have major issue with IRA core cash sweeps and TDA/Schwab not allowing us to use MMFs as collateral for options trading.  Other brokerages allow you to keep core positions of cash in govt-based money market funds and still use as collateral for options trading.  As an example, Fidelity automatically sweeps to SPAXX for IRA accounts, allowing clients to collect -4.6% interest on uninvested collateral.  With Schwab, anyone who trades options in an IRA only collects 0.35% interest in the standard sweep account.  Schwab makes a lot of money from core sweeps and isn’t sharing it with its clients.

This policy is likely to stay in place for the duration of inverted interest rates, so I may move the majority of my money (7 figures) to Fidelity and keep a minimal amount with TDA just to be able to use ToS for technical analyses.",1
Going through the same thing. Called this morning to see if they would do anything for me. They said I could ask for an emergency check or something but nothing else. Opened accounts at the end of October. Initiated a transfer on 11/4 and it’s expected to clear on 11/27. Since there was no indication this would occur and they refuse to do anything about it I’m immediately transferring the money out and closing my accounts when it clears. This just screams incompetence to me. My sentiment after this is to stay away from these big established brokerages.,0

"Yes, TD Ameritrade provides software which in their customer agreement is not 100 percent reliable. In reality, is 99.99% reliable. And in the 0.01 percent of cases, the majority of the cases where they are at fault they do make an adjustment in the customer's favor. This is exactly the same at every other broker. Your concept of ""insurance"" is not in any way applicable in this situation.

As far as ""banks,"" in your example, if you are using a bank's app, and the app failed due to their error, for example, you deposited a check electronically, but it failed to deposit, then they would likely also treat this the same way, in other words, they would look at the situation and make a judgment in favor of the customer or in favor of the bank. No ""insurance"" would every be involved there either. If you are ""scared"" of this, then perhaps investing or trading using electronic software may not be the best option for you, honestly. Why not just go visit a branch in person and be less ""scared?""",1

For faster service you can use wire transfers, but there is a charge for outgoing wire transfers on both, and moomoo is a little cheaper.

TDA charges $25 for outgoing transfers (both domestic and international), while the moomoo fees you quoted above are a little less.

I think the most significant reason to think about moomoo is that it is a Chinese company.

"That is the insidiousness of eToro.  Their schtick is not to steal your money, but to steal your money FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.

The good point is that you always can easily check the fees being payed for a given position.",0

"Not OP but I switched from TurboTax to SimpleTax (before the Wealthsimple acquisition) because:

* I think Wealthsimple Tax's UI has been better and simpler to use than TurboTax, and offers better help resources if I don't understand something.
* Wealthsimple Tax is honestly free to use compared to TurboTax which has a free option with a lot of asterisks to make sure people end up paying (employment expenses, investment income, donations and medical expenses all disqualify you from being a ""simple tax return"" and force you into a paid tier).
* Intuit is a horrible business actively lobbying governments against making tax returns simpler/automatic. I'd much rather support Wealthsimple, even if I did have to pay for my tax return with them.",1
100% understood. I use both and each has its strengths. But ToS is by far more customizable and extendable. It had a 10 year head start and has had more development put into it. Hearing the guys that developed both I get the strong impression that they weren’t trying to just make a new version of ToS with Tasty. I think they were looking for the most streamlined platform for advanced retail traders of a certain type.,1

"It is the first time I hear about this Generation benefit not being available *at all* to Quebec residents - and yet this benefit is being presented to me in the App alongside all the other benefits.

The lack of support for QESI in your RESP offering is also not mentioned anywhere on your website (as far as I can tell) - and yet you let Quebec residents open such an account, effectively letting them forgo a critical benefit of an RESP (the Provincial grant!), which is borderline irresponsible in my opinion.

The common element to both situations: WS made the conscious decision to hide those limitations from your Quebec customers, instead of being honest and up front with them.

I get that doing business in Quebec is more complicated vs the rest of Canada and that sometimes you can't offer parity. All I ask is that you are honest, open and up front with what's unavailable.",0
"I'd like to give some positive insight here. My family has been with Merrill Lynch for over 40+ years dating back to when my grandfather first started investing. Hundreds of thousands of dollars invested through my family and Merrill Lynch. Always been a positive experience and their customer service is top notch. I to this day also use their platform with an account that values over $25k+. I will attest that during all of the fiasco going on with Robinhood restricting trading for various equities, Merrill Lynch had kept those same equities fully open with no trading regulations in place for well over a week. I enjoy the platform and the MarketPro tool they offer. Like anything it has a learning curve at first, but if you traditionally understand any broker interface this wouldn't be hard to grasp. The tools are outstanding and the market research is what puts Merrill over the top imo. 

I do however advice against trading options there as every option trade costs $0.65 per contract. That's an extra $1.3 to factor in to whatever strike price you are targeting for your call or put option.

For this reason I use Webull. Free option trading and I would say it's the second most easiest platform for new option traders to grasp and understand.",1
Same here. Had a couple of meetings  with Fidelity advisers and they gave some good advise like telling me I had to diversify more which I did need to. But another time I went back they tried selling me an annuity. They keep hounding me to hire them at around 1% a year but I said no. But they keep calling. I’ve invested part of my money in an S&P fund and money in another account in a total market fund and QQQ. Plus some individual stocks plus I’ll put a small amount in a real estate fund. I think overall you can’t do to much better.,1

"If you call, you will at least get a straight answer. 

I called on 10-OCT-2024 and the rep explained that any electronic deposits (literally anything than mailing or hand delivering a paper check to cash) now has a clearance time of up to 16 business days (vs 1-5 before). Likewise, debit cards stopped going out early September.

The rep sounded genuinely sympathetic to the problem, which was appreciated. I knew he had no control over it and couldn't have gotten an answer to when these policies will revert no matter how hard he tried.

Now for personal conjecture part - they are trying to do as much sweeping under the rug as possible. Just like with Chase - it was a flaw in **their** system that allowed bogus checks to be cashed. So while they aren't to blame for people committing credit card fraud, they still aren't bothering to take any corrective and preventative actions. 

I'm guessing that means whoever built their software was a 3rd party contractor and not in-house staff. So the delay is going to be for them to go through the super long and super bureaucratic process of finding a contractor who is the lowest bidder but still able to do a better job than the last one :-/",0
"Your situation sounds very specific to the US side. IBKR should be good for you but I am based in the southern hemisphere so they're not as good for me for the lag. Their platform TWS does have a pretty steep learning curve though once you get used to it they're excellent. I would have stayed with them if not for their lag and their customer service who copy and paste from a template regardless of your issue so that's to be warned. Payment wise they're pretty good they will give you a date straight up when you should expect it in your account but it's normally 2-3 business days and they have a much stringent fraud prevention and security measures so you'd probably have your funds held a bit longer than you expect for a standard procedure so that's a heads up for you but overall they are an excellent platform that tells you what to expect.

Not sure about Fidelity. I can't open an account with them on the southern hemisphere.

Moomoo released my funds rather quickly after I emailed them, probably partly because I am based in the southern hemisphere where they have a separate office. I can't say for sure but I do have to give credits where credits due since I got mine resolved although the customer service experience was far from pleasant. I can only say I hold a higher bar because I came from customer service background myself and they need a lot of work on that front.",0

"You need to have your attorneys send them a mail with action required.  We had to do this one time to them and they answer IMMEDIATELY.

Fidelity is a good brokerage, but they cross the line sometimes by closing accounts without notice.  I use my attorneys from my trust matters to deal with this crap when it happens.  

Also, I highly recommend you use multiple brokerages such as Schwab and Vanguard as well, split up your investments between each.

Finally, use multiple banks to store intermediate funds that you use regularly and have backup local credit unions.

If you are at home a lot and have it secured, I'd also recommend holding a bit of cash and some gold/silver bars... not too much, but enough to get you by if something bad happens.

Always be prepared for this kind of crap, it's only going to get worse.  But you DO need some attorneys on your side - they don't charge me unless I use them... and Fidelity is the worst in my experience pulling this crap.

If I own 100 shares of Company X that I purchased at $50/share then I've invested $5000. If Company X's stock price drops to $0.00, I've lost my $5000 investment but I'm not in debt or have a negative balance, I simply own 100 shares worth $0.00 each.

However, if they were trading options or short selling, there could be some money owed on those contracts. But in that case if there's any debt owed I don't think it would transfer to the beneficiary, but would probably want to check with a lawyer on that. Worst case you would work with a financial advisor that would help you close out any outstanding option contracts and pay whatever fees are owed on those contracts from the owner's brokerage account. But I don't believe you would be out of pocket yourself for those since they are a contract and you did not sign the contract. Again, verify this with a lawyer if needed. 

Schwab has very excellent customer service, if you contact them they will be able to answer any of your questions.",1
"Exactly, I must say their preferred rewards program is good though. I use Merrill of secondary account that housed approximately 100k in assets to get 75% booster on the cashbacks.

I hold others at Schwab. Much better UI and amazing customer service.",0
"Absolutely correct.   
I experienced the same thing. Moreover, the price would fluctuate radically on Feb 10, 2021.   
I called it in and as expected several other customer had done the same account to rep Francesco Biasi. He kindly offered to clear a complaint and suggested that by morning all would be in order, as it did. However, this is an indication there are serious flaws with Merrill Edge (Bank of America) trading infrastructure and , more importantly, the fact that Merrill Edge allows folks to buy SNDL but yet imposes some weird fee after the fact and manipulates the price. If the stock is blocked, then so be it. But don't change the rules of the game at half time.   


This entire fiasco has caused me to re-evaluate using Merril Edge (Bank of America).",1
"I hated Schwab so much, not intuitive and often have to click multiple times to get the right info. E.g. after submitting an order, and it’s executed, going to the order status page does not give me the total amount of the order (unless you multiple quantity by price), and I have to go to the history page to find the total amount of the order.",0

"Trading212's Cash ISA is currently 4.5%. It's a lot better than S&P500 over the last year (admittedly, that is heavily skewed by the past 3-4 months). Given the volatility, it's a safer bet over the next 12 months; it is in any unknown 12 month period to be honest, but especially at the moment.",1
"As I understand that investigation, the H&R scam was that someone became an authorized representative for the victims with the CRA.  I don't think that happens when you use software like WealthSimple, I've used them for years but I've never seen them as authorized for me when I am in the CRA portal.",1
Yea I love Freetrade… absolutely love it. But desktop interface is 100% necessary. It’s that simple,1
"One of the biggest benefits having both is the credit card cashback boost depending on your tiers with preferred rewards.

Also it’s nice to see all your money under one app.  Instant transfer between accounts.  

When I transferred from M1 finance, it was either fidelity or merrill.  One commenter suggested to just get merrill since I have relationship with them already.  Glad I did.  I hear fidelity has some holding times with money transfer.",1
"Looks cool but you might want to consider a profession platform over TOS. You're obviously invested in trading and hardware so maybe trade with a broker that doesn't get paid for orderflow, actually has some risk management capabilities and brokers who have actually traded a share of stock or options. Hell, use Robinhood for the same Citadel fills, get better margin rates and free options trading.",0
"I talked with customer care this morning. Just in general, Charles Schwab is backlogged to hell. After everything that happened with Robinhood, folks started looking for new brokers. I’d just give it time. I’ve been waiting on a checking account for 6 days and was given similar advice a few days ago. It’ll all work out when they catch up.",0
"Customer service is AWFUL! As someone who manages a busy business and handles customer service, ibkr is just atrocious. Notifications and bulletins don't properly display, and then I can't reach a rep by phone. I have to hold for an HOUR, and then when the rep got on the line, he put me on hold again for over an hour. It was so long that their customer service closed and I was unable to do the transfer. So I used another brokerage but unfortunately lost money from the missed opportunity.

With a normal broker, you can transfer funds in 30 min. But ibkr takes minimum 3 business days. They tell you to wire it, but it's the 21st century - no bank does wires anymore bc you can e transfer! But ibkr can't handle etransfers in a timely manner.

I think you get what you pay for. I'm closing my account. My time is worth more than the ""savings"" from fees from ibkr.",0
"Go for an ECN trader, not a market maker broker like Etoro. Market makers work against you and are incentivized to cause your losses at their profit.

Thank you so much!  I loved the TDA app. I’m still trying to learn think or swim app. Can’t grasp it yet either. Schwab absolutely horrendous. I’m so disappointed. I just got moved over this week and it’s been so hard!,0
"Regulations in Latin American countries to fight money laundering. Panama is black listed by eToro and in Costa Rica no bank will receive any funds from eToro. BAC and BCR (Banco Costa Rica), first bank being private and the latter being state owned. Add to the list all cooperatives, Davivienda and Mutual and not any of them will accept funds sent from eToro. This is getting really frustrating.",1
"We also keep checking and money market accounts at our local credit union. I have seen posts of people trying to deposit large third party checks directly into Fidelity and the account being frozen. We almost always deposit checks like that in our credit union account and once it clears, we transfer the cash from the CU to Fidelity. We also can withdraw money from Fidelity and send directly to the credit union. I personally think it’s safer. We do use the Fidelity credit card for the 2% cash back.",1
"It's good most of the time. They have the phone lines staffed 24/7 and it never takes long for a rep to pick up. They also seem to be American based if that matters to you.

However, a few months ago I had a routine issue that ended up turning into a huge ordeal mostly due to the phone reps not being familiar with how it worked. This dragged on for a month and throughout the process I had many phone calls with different reps and I often got contradictory instructions and advice. I couldn't directly talk to the department that was working on my issue and the phone reps only seemed to communicate with them through notes. There was a lot of miscommunication and it cost me money.

I wouldn't let this discourage you though as the phone reps are nice people who try their best. The CS beats most places, especially nowadays. Just don't try to remove an excess contribution from a Roth IRA at TD Ameritrade lol.",1

"Research SpreadBetting first of all.  But if you really want to trade CFD's, I would suggest you use IBKR.  The spreads can be brutal on T212, and they move the spreads as well (typically not in your favour!!  Furthermore, T212 charges overnight fees on things like Futures, which other brokers don't.  Be careful as you go forward and think about what I have said here.   You can lose money RAPIDLY with leverage, and playing with a paper account on a video-game style app like T212, is dangerous in real-life, with real money.  Best of luck!",0
"It could be due to your account being less than 30 days old and the bank you are transferring to is not the original bank that you deposited money into TDA with. I had this issue, and after the month, it was resolved. It is incredibly frustrating as you don’t have complete control of your own money.",0
"Let's be real here, ME pales in comparison to the giants like Schwab, Fidelity, and Vanguard. Their offerings and customer service just don't measure up. The only reason I'm still here? Those credit rewards. Without them, I'd have jumped ship ages ago. Here's hoping they step up their game soon.",0
"In addition to the Preferred Deposit mentioned, the BIG benefit of Preferred Rewards is the 75% credit card bonus. Combine that with the Premium Rewards card and you’ll get 2.62% cash back on all purchases and 3.5% on travel and dining (a very liberally defined category). It’s pretty hard to beat that across the board. 

Note, usually Preferred Rewards takes 3 months to get, but since it sounds like you don’t have a checking account with them yet, if you open one and have $100K in Merrill, you should get it in a few days. The first 30 days of your first checking account is treated special.

And yes, their savings is shit. Preferred Deposit is pretty solid, but slightly annoying to manage, especially on mobile. Worth the APR though. Details: https://www.ml.com/solutions/preferred-deposit.html",1
"1. You can start investing with any amount of money. You can add more money into the same investment, or add money to the account and put it towards a different investment.

2. FXAIX is a mutual fund. So you can invest $50 into that fund. With mutual funds, you typically invest a dollar amount. The value of the fund changes each days. Currently it’s roughly $208/share. So a $50 investment on Monday would get you roughly 0.25 shares.  Every time you invest an additional $50, you’d get a different number of shares depending on the current price/share. So you may get 0.25 shares, or 0.27 shares, or 0.15 shares.  But as you continue to invest, you’ll acquire more and more shares.

3. Limit orders are more advanced and not something you need to be concerned with at first.  With mutual funds you typical don’t really use limit orders anyway. 

So for you I’d find one or two mutual funds that you think are good, long-term investments and start putting your money into those.

Remember, investments can go down too, so only invest what you’re willing to lose. That’s rule #1.

Also Fidelity has a TON of resources on investing and trading. From basics to advanced info. Check out the Learning Center (you can search for it in the Fidelity) search bar.",1
"My experience with Schwab's fraud department has been perfectly positive. In my experience they'll freeze the funds, do their research and in a couple days will contact you with whatever else is necessary. 

It may or may not be a PITA, but if this as in fact fraud you'll eventually be made whole.",1

"The solution is pretty simple: don't use Trading212/eTorro.

Use  a real share-broker like IBKR, Vanguard, AJ Bell, Hargreaves Lansdown, etc. instead.

The one advantage CFDs have in the UK, not sure about other countries, is they're not subject to capital gains tax - for me that's never been a good enough reason to use them, and I don't touch platforms like Trading212 with a 10-foot pole.",0

They are constantly brining out new features",1

Deposited on Dec 13th and won't clear until Jan 9th.  Reported to FINRA because unlike Schwab, they somehow don't cooperate with the CFPB.  Livid.",0
"I opened a Schwab checking account online, initiated an ACH push transfer from my bank, but right after the funds were received 2 days later Schwab closed my new account without notice with no reason given. Getting my money back was a hellish experience. A year or so later I tried opening an account with Schwab again and yet again they gave me an account number, allowed me to login, but then closed it without notice and for no explicable reason a couple days later.

All of these brokerages and financial institutions have their issues. Luckily, I've always been aware of the delays with pulling funds so I've never had any problems with Fidelity. I always initiate transfers from the sending side. I'd personally recommend staying away from Schwab.",1
