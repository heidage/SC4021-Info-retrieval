Schwab is fine for investment, but their response times in the app are horrible, so regular trading is impossible. ToS is available after your migration, but the new version of the app just doesn't respond very well, as though the server just can't handle the traffic. regular trading requires speed, and Schwab just doesn't seem to have it.",-1

"So some of what you've said here isn't correct. 

As far as checks, you may or may not get them depending on the account types and how long you've had the checking set up on the td side. 

Ach stuff doesn't take 30 days to change over. You do need to start using the schwab checking info as soon as you get it, but there's a grace period. Checks from the td stuff will still be cashed up til June 12th. Afterward things will be rejected. Not sure when you were told 90 days, but that's inaccurate.  I'd suspect if you were told that if you were assigned to a previous transition group before being moved to the final wave.

"In my opinion, Fidelity and Charles Schwab are top tier.

I'm still with CS because thinkorswim keeps me there. There is a learning curve, but it's one of the best out there. Significantly better than Active Trader Pro, which is what I assume you were using with Fidelity.

Second recommendation might be Webull. The desktop trading platform is smooth and responsive, unlike the .NET framework of ATP and old java of TOS (thinkorswim).

Here is my rating list, if you are curious. TD Ameritrade would have been the only one in S tier, but they got bought out by CS. I have current accounts at all of these except for Tradestation (closed it out last year).

S Tier: Fidelity, Charles Schwab  
A Tier: Webull  
B Tier: Tradovate, TastyTrade, Tradestation  
C Tier: E\*Trade, Vanguard, Robinhood  
D Tier: IBKR, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Edge

Good luck!",-1
"I almost moved to Schwab, but found out they don’t do fractional trading on ETFs. That’s a deal breaker for me. The UI/UX is horrendous with Vanguard.

"Alright, let’s tone down the attitude and focus on the real issue. I fully understand that eToro has the right to decide where they operate and who they serve. But what I’m pointing out is how **an online platform**, which promotes global accessibility, can seriously screw over customers with how they handle situations like this.

Closing an account completely—without clear terms specifying how long someone is allowed to temporarily reside abroad—is how companies end up blindsiding or outright screwing their customers. A read-only restriction or some other less drastic option would have been a more reasonable approach. Instead, they chose the nuclear option, which feels like an overreach, especially since I’m not asking them to break laws or operate where they’re not licensed.

So no, it’s not hard for me to understand their right to operate as they choose—it’s hard to accept why anyone would defend such a tone-deaf way of handling customers. This is exactly how companies end up rear-ending people, and it’s not acceptable.",-1

"Yeah man I agree. I did an ACATs into IBKR, transferred 3000 and then I got a new job and had to buy a car but they wouldn’t let me pull the 3000. Called them on the phone and mic quality was awful and they weren’t very clear. I got a ticket response 1 day later stating it was the ACATs and why. It still doesn’t explain why my 3000 dollars had to be locked up as that wasn’t part of the ACATs",-1
"Note that holding VFV in one brokerage and ZSP in another can trigger other issues around superficial loss.

https://financialpost.com/personal-finance/taxes/jamie-golombek-tax-loss-selling-in-july-dont-get-tripped-up-by-the-superficial-loss-rules

>One final caveat about the superficial loss rules in the context of identical properties and index funds or exchange-traded funds. In 2001, the CRA stated that, in its view, index funds from different financial institutions are considered to be identical properties if they track the same index (say, the S&P/TSX composite), so simply selling one index fund and replacing it with a similar one from another issuer could trigger the superficial loss rules if it hasn’t been at least 30 days.

Both VFV and ZSP track the S&P500, so selling one and buying the other within a 30-day period can prevent you from claiming capital losses. You'd have to use funds that track different indices, like VFV (S&P500) and VUN (S&P Total Market), to avoid this issue.",-1

"Yeah. I get what people are saying, it makes sense that the net deposits would be across all accounts, but given that this promo has a specific registered investment angle, which are typically head for longer terms without withdrawls, I can understand why people like myself interpreted it differently given the long term holding nature of those investments.

During the last 1% promo, I had budgeted in a significant margin (ex: to buy a car, mortgage prepayment), working with a WS rep, so that my bonus would be calculated on a lesser amount. What I am curious is, if they are going to calculate the net balances across all my accounts at time of transfer in for the new promo, or in addition to the previous net threshold amount that I negotiated (and that shows up in the app). Not sure if this makes sense. I emailed the WS rep for clarity. If they were to remove my eligibility for the new promo, based on me withdrawing funds from my cash account (within the buffer of the original net proceeds), that would be very frustrating and I would definitely take my business elsewhere to take advantage of another institutions promos.",-1
"Apologies if this question does not belong here but I am at the end of my tether!  

Condor Gold sold to Metals Exploration mid January and whilst I have been credited with the  cash  compensation of 9.9p per share I am yet to receive the Metals Exploration shares to my account. In fact, even though Condor Gold was delisted on the 14th January they are still showing on my IBKR account!

Despite complaining to IBKR that Metals Exploration shares should have been credited to accounts by now I just get the usual response that I simply must wait!  Its most likely my ignorance and that it does actually take 2 months for new takeover shares to be credited but the lack of customer support is driving me mad.

Can anyone shed any light please? is there any IBKR users who had Condor Gold in the same position? If its any use my Condor Gold shares were on the TSX as I could not buy them on the LSE.

"Been down this rabbit hole recently … unfortunately TOS scanners more or less don’t work pre market (from talking with live chat I don’t think it’s getting updated anytime soon and there is a delay on the data as well).  

If you add mark% change and mark price to scanner/watchlist it helps filter pre/post market still is not great (always missing info and including random anomalies like reverse splits and other bs)

Best solution IMO is pulling up YouTube on your monitor/phone/ipad whatever and watch zendoo channel live scanner… I’m pretty sure it’s exactly what your looking for and has only a 3 second stream delay… all momentum scanners(up and down) and halt information which is really helpful during market hours.  

I usually check it in the evening also and plan out potential runners to look for the following day by creating a watchlist in TOS from what looks good to me based on float volume news and load some into charts if they look good and maybe draw some TA lines… then I wake up and confirm or deny / update my stuff getting ready for the open.

GL hope this helps",-1
"By the way, you aren't really earning interest when you invest in most ETFs like ZEQT. You earn dividends - that is the yield - which are payments made to shareholders from companies for performing well (usually). There is also a capital gain/loss, which is the difference between the share price when you sell compared to when you purchased.
Some ETFs like ZMMK and CASH.TO have distributions that are interest because they are like a high interest savings account. 
I mention this because account interest is considered safe - like a GIC, but the low risk means low reward.  Buying stocks can lead to losses or dividend cuts during market downturns (2008 financial crisis, covid, etc). The key is to NOT SELL so you don't realize the loss when this happens.  Wait it out so the value bounces back.",-1

the fidelity agent, of course, mentioned I can “simply” reimburse myself sometime in the future (after they institute a hold on transferring that money back to myself). it’s horseshit. no small amount of interest or dividends makes a hold like that reasonable in any sort of way. it should be criminal, but this is the great ol’ USA so f@&$ consumers.",-1

"Not sure about that but trading CFDs on eToro will lead you to lose all the traded funds over time. When using CFD, you are betting against eToro. They set their system up in a way where this will happen. With pure abuse. Then they will direct you to their terms and conditions which make no clear statement of them being able to manipulate their platform to do so. So far, they get away with it sufficiently to make it a core part of their business model.

Most people find this hard to believe when it happens to them. Once it does, they get worn out by very streamlined, even if non intelligent, process run by their reps, which hand a client over to eachother continuously. Vast majority of people do not end up suing and they keep all relevant information on their end, so you are in adeliberately  exceptionally inferior position to take action. They then deploy shills, if you post on a public forum, who try to quickly stifle a discussion by insisting you must be a bad investor or a liar. 

This is their MO. I would advise against shorting, leveraging,.. on this platform. Due to this unaffiliated group having a rule to not divert users away from Etoro, a substantial chunk of criticism, regardless of how well founded, may get a post deleted. They also may disappear then from google searches, etc. Which is what eToro hopes for and also spends money on. It is not a neutral platform.

"""Push"" from the source bank side to Fidelity.  Don't pull from Fidelity.  Check deposits are considered a ""pull"".  Not always an option since banks can have stingy ACH transfer limits, but do it when possible.

I have noticed that I avoid the hold when the deposited check amount is a small percentage of the accounts total balance.  Depositing a $500 check into an account with a $2000 balance?  Hold.  $5000 check into an account with a $500k balance?  No hold.  So total amount of deposits doesn't matter as much as the account being deposited to.  That $500 check deposit is a small fraction of all of my Fidelity accounts, but if it goes into a small balance account, it gets a hold.

> It leads me to believe either their fraud problem is so bad that they don't care about alienating existing clients or their risk assessment process is completely broken.

These holds don't alienate me.  If I pull $50K into Fidelity, I get to use the funds immediately.  Even before the check clears.  I'm just restricted from withdrawing the funds.  If I wanted to withdraw the funds, why would I have put it into Fidelity in the first place?",-1

I have just been told, after submitted the transfer request via IBKR more than a month ago, FT never received my request because I wrongly assumed that the ""Freetrade number"" on the top of the account page is my account reference ... (turns out the account reference is buried deep inside the top up > standing order page ... who'd have thought?) 

Anyway, I've just submitted another transfer request 5 mins ago and thought it is probably the end of it? Then I saw your thread and the £17 per position handling fee shenanigan ... sigh, Freetrade, do you really have to be this annoying?",-1
Iyeah I can’t find them. I might have to just call them. I hate Schwab,-1
"I got the same issue. I transfered part of the balance from HealthEquity HSA to Fidelity HSA and HealthEquity just freezed my HSA account even I still had a few hundreds in the account...

  
UPDATE: called the HealthEquity support. It looks like HealthEquity will freeze the account for 5 days if there is a pending transfer, but if there are still balance (>$50) in HealthEquity HSA account, they won't close the account.",0

"They are being reported.... But is it considered 'earned income' for the purpose of claiming child care costs? Because without them technically I have the lower earned income compared to my husband.

Wealthsimple Tax is automatically applying it to my husbands taxes but I am thinking I should get it if RRSPs aren't considered to be 'earned income'",0
"The fact you are asking instead of applying with your accurate information means you don’t qualify per their compliance. If you don’t find a different broker or maybe consider don’t trade options until you have a better situation. They denied you for a reason if you applied accurately. If you lied and inflated numbers and they still said no don’t push it as they do ask for source of wealth or source of income docs. Had to upload copy of stock plan assets, 401(k), IRA, etc to get my stuff approved last year.",0
"VWRP and FWRG track the FTSE index, whilst ACWI tracks the MSCI index. They’re functionally the same concept. The yields may differ slightly between the two indexes in the short term, but over time they should perform pretty much identically. There are bound to be minor differences in tracking and spread, but this shouldn’t really matter over the long term. 

VWRP is provided by Vanguard and is more well known, so tends to be popular for that reason, despite being a bit more expensive than the other two options. FWRG has a lower TER, and ACWI a lower TER again (although this was only reduced within the last year). At this level you’re pretty much splitting hairs, so either will be fine. I personally tend to sway more towards ACWI, purely for the slightly lower fees. 

You should generally always buy a fund in your home currency to avoid FX fees.",0
"Just call Fidelity and tell them you want your money ultimately in a Roth IRA so that you don’t have to pay tax on it when you withdraw your money later. They should help with the rollover.
Don’t worry about your old employer’s stupid mutual fund. Put it in a cheap (low fee) S&P 500 ETF or low gross fee target date retirement fund and forgetaboudit.",0
"A momo setup: look for news and adjust scanners. Watch target L2 with an eye on a 133 tick chart with macd and Williams percent and another eye one minute time chart.  If you can afford the service use a 10 second chart.  In and out of trades in seconds.

Everything happens on the L2 in near to real time as possible, all other indicators lag.  All. Control your emotional expectations in the moment. 

A day trade setup: pretty much same setup, a little less live L2 influence, more macd and percent influence, several charts from 5 minute to 30 minute are up.  Trades last from several minutes to hours.  

Swing trade, seasonal trade, buy and hold, dividends....  all have unique approaches to trading styles.  Ya really gotta trade paper for a few months to develope your own styles...

Lots of videos and training to be followed out there.

Good luck.",0
"I am in the same boat as you and I agree. The benefit of switching has outweighted the hassel.

Be aware of [£17 per non-uk holding trasfer fee](https://freetrade.io/transferring-to-other-providers) if you decided to do a portfolio transfer",0
"Just use PPS, there isn't a better pivot indicator imo than PPS, there's a reason why the code for it is a secret. It's a vanilla indicator on tos just search for it, hide the PPS lines, keep the arrows.. guarantee it's better than whatever that is. Or grab thinkscript code for supertrend, one by Mobius is good but there is a lot of them out there..just Google ""mobius supertrend"" and you'll find a forum where he posted the code for it on a forum. Why do you want this one in particular? guarantee it's just printing EMA crossover or something simple like that.",0
"Hi u/bruno7123,

This is a distribution from a fund (not a stock buyback) that includes dividends, as well as short-term and long-term capital gains.  

Please be aware we can't give opinions or tax advice.  

Hope that helps! 🐮

\- Sean, Customer Service Director (US)",0
"Cheers. I am aware of that strategy. I've been invested in a managed fund with 72% USA exposure and 1% fees for many years. It's down 10% now, of course. I'm slightly panicking. Do you think it's 100% not the end of era of investing in USA and everything will get sorted out? I'm still with the fund, but can't imagine bright future any more. Pretty crazy times. I'm also homeless.

So I have another 10% to invest will have a look at that Wisdom AI, and probably all world FTSE (not that I know that it's good) because I already have a lot of USA.

👍

Edit: TLDR: I'm invested in USA. Do you think USA troubles will blow over or will my money burn?",0

"I am mostly a buy and hold type of trader but I do sell from time to time. this is all my experience and I'll try to answer your questions


I joined as a gold member originally and up till now I have not dealt with any hidden fees. The fees are explained at the beginning. I would like to add a few points to this though.


• I have a taxable self account. There is the regulatory fee that you'll pay at any broker as it's a federal one; it's basically a 1¢ for most stocks sold unless it's a huge amount.

• If you also decide to buy foreign stocks, be ready for a withheld of X.XX amount when selling them or collecting dividends. Again this is basically every broker and it's a tax thing. 

• ETFs have a sell fee of 1¢ - 3¢ per $1,000 principal. Something people tend to forget after they open. I think this is just Merrill edge, not sure.


As a mostly buy and hold person, I do not need to dabble that much with the PC version. So I cannot comment on that. Other than that I like all the tools that are offered for researching stocks.


I can say that the mobile version is very barebone when it comes to trading but it has a quick buy and sell button. I find it significantly easier to place my buy order with a limit on Mobile. Just confirm the amount of shares you want, at what price, and how long to keep the order open. 


The margins are for people who are going to trade with debt basically. (More complicated than that) I don't mess with that so I won't comment on it.


I never had to call so I cannot comment on this either. I heard the war stories of needing to wait 3 - 5 hours though.


Here are some extra things I found nice to know.


• If you want to trade penny stocks then this isn't the broker for you. They black list so many penny stocks. I heard Merrill edge blocks companies that don't have a certain amount of capital.

• They also block certain covered call ETFs. Like NUSI is blocked but you can trade JEPI. I do not know what the criteria for these 

• You can't buy fraction shares, but you can turn on DRIP and have your dividends reinvest themselves if you choose so.

This was kinda long, but I hope it was helpful. If I got something wrong, I hope someone corrects me. If you have any other questions I'll try to answer them.

Im transferring my full account to ETRADE. Both of their apps are very good so far. The Schwab app is comically bad. TOS is okay but Etrade I think is better.,0
"I’ve done various of strategies with ML. CC, CSP, butterflies, calendar spreads. Overall, they are okay. Fills are not horrible. I frequently get fills inside the bid ask spread on spread trades. It would be nice to have the Greeks on the app. One spread strategy I wish they would add to the native order set is a collar.",0
"To add both a stop loss and take profit order to an existing position, use an OCO (one-cancels-other) order type. OCO is actually 2 orders and if one fills the other is cancelled.

https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/creating-one-cancels-other-orders-on-thinkorswim

If you want to open a position and at the same time add a stop loss and take profit, use a 1st Triggers OCO order type. That's 3 orders: 1 to open the position and when that is filled, an OCO for your stop loss and take profit order is triggered.",0

"Yeah, the weak dollar doesn’t help when all the electronics and clothes that used to be cheaper in the US are now double the price. Plus you can be randomly detained and sent to an immigration centre if you make a mistake with your visa so probably a good idea to avoid travelling to the US for the foreseeable future.",0
"I think this is wild.

Boycotts, 70% reduction in travel to the US, flights diverted away from active airspace that's a warzone, increase in high profile safety issues and crashes, an overall indication that the world is about to enter a period of conflict, increase in cost of fuel, increase in cost of materials to maintain planes, increase in cost of hospitality. Even before America there was a massive rhetoric in the med countries to lower tourism as it was harming the local populations. We've not even seen what the EU is going to do with reciprocal tariffs yet, they could absolutely fuck tourism with tariffs. Global warming....mate I could go on and on about why I'd imagine this to be a terrible idea.

You're also not just looking at the bigger picture here, even if we ignore everything I've said. Tariffs mean price increases. Price increases mean people have less to spend. When people have less to spend, they are less likely to go on holiday.

But overall, I just think nothing screams ""lads holiday in Zante"" more than World War 3.

"I think you are using margin. so if you have 100k, please buy 100k SGD of shares, then you won't get margin called, if you buy even 120k worth of shares whatever is NOT your money, (20k) there's still chance of margin call. I don't think you can recover this loss easily, your best bet is to find another broker, without using margin, keep your remaining money and hope Tesla goes back down to that price in any volatility, and then buy in using full cash non margined.",0

"the fraud issue is simply overblown. think like retail stores where theft is a thing you simply cannot prevent completely. they call that ""shrinkage"" and that's why you have bored guards at entrances and little gate scanners and the like. it doesn't solve fraud but mitigates it a little. 

the same is the case with transfer fraud. it's a small amount of lost cash that the banks can fully absorb and put in their balance sheets as cost of doing business. 

meanwhile, the narrative of ""OMG fraud is eating the universe"" is a PR gimmick to mitigate lost revenue now that end users got wise to the fact that using a high yield money market account instead of a useless checking account is much smarter.

of course it also means that suddenly, less cash is available for fidelity (and its brethren) to generate yield with. at their scale that's billions of dollars of course.

"In case you don't use ChatGPT, you should start. Here is the reply:



You're good. If you hold 100 shares of $AAAA and sell 1 call contract, IBKR will treat it as a covered call — not naked — and your shares will be used for assignment if the call is exercised.

💡 Here’s how it works:

If the call buyer exercises, IBKR will automatically deliver your 100 shares to fulfill the obligation.

It will not liquidate your cash or treat it as a naked call just because your account can do naked trades.

✅ As long as you hold the 100 shares in the same account and they’re not pledged or loaned out, IBKR will always prioritize using your shares at assignment.

⚠️ Just make sure:

You're not short the shares

The shares aren't being used as collateral for margin in a way that prevents assignment

You don’t close out the shares before expiration

So yes — sleep easy. If you’re selling calls against shares you own, IBKR will handle assignment correctly and use the shares, not your cash.",0
"Is this true though? 

My understanding was that a standard split is done by the broker’s accounting systems and just multiplies your number of shares. Whereas a dividend like the one GME issued means that the brokers have to receive the shares from the company before they can issue them to shareholders.

As long as you are paying taxes on the money you put in the Traditional IRA you don’t have to worry about income limits. At least that’s how I understand it.

Yeah just share it like you normally do. It does take a day for the link to work on schwab tos though,0
"The Internet has been here for so long and everyone has been taught and reminded again and again not to believe everything you see and hear online. These ""influencers"" are humans like you too, and to err is human. Even the so-called ""good"" ones will fail you sometime in the future. You just got to learn from different people, find out who are the good ones, or what they are good at, test them with time, take whatever they say with a grain/bucket of salt, AND formulate your OWN thinking. 

You are given a brain to think and form your own judgement, don't blindly follow them. So what if you shut down all Sg finance influencers? Overseas finance influencers will fill up the void and if they are shit, who are you going to complain to? 

And people say Singaporeans love to complain...haizzz",0
"The immediately available part is nice to avoid margin interest. Fidelity used to take days to do an ACH. I was pleasantly surprised with the first time I did that with TDA, and the margin subject to interest immediately decreased to zero.",0
"You just sell them normally. 

By default, Schwab will sell the shares you’ve held for the longest time, unless you have explicitly changed your preferred tax lot method for your Schwab account to LIFO (last in, first out) in which case, Schwab will sell the most recently acquired shares first.",0
"This person is probably just bitter that they pulled cash into Fidelity, instead of pushed from another institution, and then found out they have to wait 3 weeks to withdraw (not buy equities) the cash. This was put in place to fight the rampant check fraud that started with Chase and then moved to Fidelity.",0
huh 10k? You buying whole life with 1mil CI and ECI siboh? Get a term life will be might cheaper lah. And ECI (this one is personal take) to me is not worth it one coz usually it will only set the person back about 5-6 months away from work to recuperate nia.,0
"I echo OP’s recommendation to call and (politely) bend the ear of a rep. I had a good long conversation with a rep who was also an options trader and he was entirely sympathetic. He is also teaching himself TOS out of necessity.

He did confirm that

1) most accounts have TOS available.

2) you have to log onto the website  to activate TOS for your account.

3) some custodial accounts are not eligible for TOS.

4) Schwab is working on making more of these accounts available on TOS.

As to the last point, it is up to us to hold their feet to the fire, because the Schwab app is hopelessly broken.",0
Almost any LLM can handle ThinkScript pretty well.   I used early versions of Chat GPT and it was fine.  Claude is generally really good for programming although I've not tried it specifically for TOS.,0
"I do like how they say, they will arrive in your account as soon as possible! Like it may take sometime to find some 😂",0
If people aren’t finding value in the tools on ToS maybe we should be suggesting basic index etf investing.  Any old platform can do that.  I’m not suggesting that’s you only that all the rage (various posters) is starting to fall in the category of recreational outrage.,0
Good job. Trading212 never abides by their estimates about releasing date. It's now another quarter.,0
"You said you're a passive investor, there is nothing that you should do/can do as big protection requires active management and all hedges come with a cost.

For active investors, there are tools like options, managed futures, inverse ETFs that can hedge or participate in the downside. All come with risks, costs and the need for market timing. 

Best you can do as a passive investor if hedging crashes is your concern is to invest in long dated bonds (can be done through ETFs like ZROZ, TLT) which often move inverse to equities, and use the appreciation in bonds to rebalance. Even then it's not completely passive unless your brokerage allows auto rebalancing. 

Endowus for example, allows you to auto rebalance if you have multiple funds in your portfolio, or use their flagship funds which already have it structured in various ratios.",0
"More than option trading that looks like options draining.

God I can't believe WS allows their clients (who let's be real, 99% have zero idea how to do any of this) to gamble with options. The service was born as a way for younger people with little knowledge on investing to easily save for their future. It was not meant for trading. Especially options.

Now the pull these things including freaking scams like the trump memecoins and options trading. I'm honestly a bit disappointed.",0
"Agree. TD is much better than Schwab, but TD's account will eventually be moved to Schwab. There's no need to have a tragic ending.",0
"Anything's possible during a trade war. But... I think China's smart enough to know, if they did something nefarious like that, Webull would be shut down in multiple countries, not just America. So, I doubt it.",0
"Schwab has started giving api approval. You need to request developer.Schwab.com

One trick limit your call back max two urls.",0
"E*Trade API website lists Python, Java and NodeJS, so I don't get the impression it is some ancient api they are about to kill off (like TDA).  I haven't used it much - TDA is the main API I use, but I have been dabbling with IBKR and Etrade, in case I have to give up on Schwab and move to one of those.",0
"Read books, invest in yourself and your own skills before throwing money at random stuff, whether that is a class A company or a well known ETF like SPY or Vanguard. 

Get yourself familiar with company technicals and how to read those or get into technical analysis charting. Either way will get you to understand potential entries for your investments instead of just buying something and then being underwater for the next half a decade while your only argument is that it’s “longterm”.",0
"Incorrect.

TD Ameritrade will let you buy on good faith, even in a cash account. The catch is you have to hold the stock/ETF you bought on good faith until the cash settles from the sale of Stock A, before you can sell Stock B.",0
"That is interesting about Ally. I see them on a lot of lists because of their customer service and user friendliness, even though their rates aren't as good as others. Maybe you can tell me more about what happened? But yeah, stick with Fidelity might be something I do, thanks!",0
"You can use a money market fund but need to buy and sell it on the website not the TOS app. The safest and best money market funds are treasury money market funds which only invest in US government treasury bills or Federal reserve repo agreements. Best options for money market funds are vanguard VUSXX, fidelity FDLXX, FZFXX, Charles Schwab SNSXX. Yield for all is above 4%. The good thing about money market funds is that their target NAV is usually $1. So when you buy or sell, you don’t have to worry about a capital gain or loss. 

Also it take a day to buy and sell it which is a bit of a pain. Another option is to buy the SGOV or BIL etf. Both ETFs basically buy 1 month, 2 month and 3 month treasury bills. They also pay a monthly dividend. Their annualized yield is above 4%. I think their yield is a bit higher than than the treasury money market funds. Being ETFs they are tradable intraday so don’t have to wait like money market funds. The downside is that there could be a small capital gain or loss depending on the price of the etf. And this may or may not create a wash-sale. 

Another option for ETFs is TFLO and USFR which invest in us treasury floating rate notes. These are similar to t-bills but usually offer a slightly higher yield.",0
"I hear you. It's very hard to be an active trader and have to change how you do things. On a positive note, I have re-examined my trading approach and have made some beneficial changes.

I don't call customer service unless I have an issue with my account. I would be happy if I never had to call them.  Transferring my whole trading account with several options and margined stock makes me want to talk to the people that I'm going to do business with.

Like you, I have to think more about how I want to do things and what button I'm pressing, and it is not the same experience I had with TDA.

I'll keep in mind what you and others have said about IBKR, but I'm done looking around, and hopefully can spend more time trading.

Best of luck and watch those buttons.",0
"I haven't checked all of them - here's a list of full service brokers [https://www.asx.com.au/investors/start-investing/find-a-broker-adviser/full-service-and-online-brokers](https://www.asx.com.au/investors/start-investing/find-a-broker-adviser/full-service-and-online-brokers)

Share trading platforms like eToro and Interactive Brokers tend to be cheaper because they don't provide all the additional services that you might not need.",0
"At the very least, Wealthsimple does not issue tax slips for the bonuses.

https://promotions.wealthsimple.com/hc/en-ca/articles/31365926340763-Wealthsimple-2025-Big-Winter-Bundle-Promotion

Tax Implications. There are tax implications to bonuses of this nature in most instances. Please consult with an accountant or tax professional for additional guidance. Wealthsimple will not be issuing clients a tax slip to report Match Bonuses or Lift Ticket issued. Clients are solely responsible for any required tax reporting.",0
It’s possible they run a credit check when considering to enable margin so there could have been an impact to your credit score.,0
Haven’t gone from fidelity with a 401k but maybe just have them stop payment and reissue…and pay for the tracking,0
"Options exercise is controlled by the OCC and all brokers will conform to their practices. 

Options that expire$.05 in the money at market close are automatically exercised. You can tell the OCC  not to exercise anITM Option and you may instruct the OCC to exercise an option that is not ITM by 5:30 Eastern time. The broker may have an earlier cutoff. IBKR deadline is 5:25. These times are for US traded options. Similar times apply to other markets. 
If you hold a short option the assignment determination will depend on if the option was exercised. 

If you don’t have the resources to satisfy a likely automatic exercise of an option IBKR will liquidate your position using a market order shortly before the market closes. You will generally be better off dealing with this situation yourself than waiting for IBKR to do it for you.",0
"This article is enough to call up and complain, just for my voice to be heard.  I suggest others do the same.  55 per million…no f’n way.  
If that’s true people like myself aren’t picking up the phone.  CS app is the biggest piece of shit I have ever used.  It’s absolutely an embarrassment that a leading US financial institution released it.  It’s not just clunky, it’s literally impossible to trade with…anyone with half a brain and trading anyway.",0
"Not a great answer, but can’t you just manually enter then correct cost basis on your taxes whenever you sell the securities?

If Merrill won’t help you, I wonder if another brokerage would correct the cost basis after you moved them using ACATS. That could help if you are concerned about the disparity between the legal cost basis and would be incorrectly reported to the IRS.",0
"Yes, it is scattered but I’m kinda learning my way around. I don’t like the way they show your cash available and margin unless it doesn’t update very fast on Schwab or Sink Or Swim.",0
"The literal worst thing it could happen is that a stock shoots 10000% in a day AND the institution that was borrowing it goes bankrupt on that very same day. 

In this case, Freetrade would sell the collateral and pay you back the money, so you'd miss on that huge gain. But that's it. That's the worst case scenario.",0
"If possible, try to exit your ILP  ifyou break even or lose not much. exit as soon as you can. Personally, I’ve never been a fan of ILPs—they’re not great products to begin with, in my opinion. Never buy insurance link with investments product.

For example (real case), a peron start investing in your mid-20s, a large portion of your premiums (say, 90%) may go toward investments, while only 10% covers mortality charges. But by your mid-40s, this could shift to 70% investments and 30% mortality charges. By your 50s, even less goes into investments, and more is allocated to mortality costs. Often, the investment returns aren’t enough to offset the rising insurance fees.

The situation worsens if you develop health issues like high cholesterol or high blood pressure. The insurer may increase your premiums or even decline coverage, leaving you with zero option, and stuck with an ILP you’ve paid into for 30 years—only to find it’s lost money at the age of 50s, that is what happened to a friend.

I’m also not a fan of unit trusts (UTs) due to their high upfront fees (3-4% or more in the first year) and ongoing management fees. However, if you have cash on hand and a 3-5 year investment horizon, you might find better returns in blue-chip stocks, especially in the current market ( masscare on the ""liberation day"" and today)",0
"I have a Wise and Wealthsimple card.

I keep a few hundred dollars on the Wise card, and everything else in Wealthsimple. 

In the *very few* instances that my Wealthsimple card doesn't work abroad, whether it be rejecting inexplicably, unsupported network, or because it's a prepaid credit card, my Wise card has saved the day. It's good to have as a backup for sure, especially abroad.",0
"Yeah it looks like annualized but I don't see similar or a iv close value on other platforms like TastyTrade, market chameleon..

Here is an example from today.. for CNQ its100 percentile but for tos it's not even anyway near. 

https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/CNQ/IV/",0
"[https://help.wealthsimple.com/hc/en-ca/articles/4409478104987-Report-interest-income-without-a-T5-slip#:\~:text=You%20must%20report%20all%20interest,records%20showing%20the%20interest%20earned](https://help.wealthsimple.com/hc/en-ca/articles/4409478104987-Report-interest-income-without-a-T5-slip#:~:text=You%20must%20report%20all%20interest,records%20showing%20the%20interest%20earned)

And a good old calculator lol",0
"I've been buying this, people said it was a waste because it doesn't grow enough but at the moment it seems a decent safe bet. 

It did dip with the liberation day stuff, what are the chances it dips again?  Is it likely to dip considerably?",0
"It sounds like your deposit hasn't cleared yet or you have other open orders in the account using buying power.

First, make sure you don't have any open orders. 

Second, does your Cash Available for Withdrawal match your cash balance? TDA web site -> My Account > Balances > Details > Cash Balances > Current value column for the rows labeled Total and Cash available for Withdrawal.

If your deposit has cleared and you haven't placed any other orders on this new account those both should match. If they don't, wait until the deposit clears.",0
"Good addition to the internet's body of knowledge :) Strange that having a beneficiary would cause this issue, but from what I've seen of Schwab's tech, I'm not entirely surprised. At least now we know it's possible to open checking online for an existing brokerage account. I was suspecting they made it difficult so as to boost their ""new brokerage accounts opened this quarter"" number.

I wonder if that solution would've worked in my case though, as it was a joint account. I know the linked checking account would also be joint. I ended up deciding it's probably safer for the checking account to not be linked to our main brokerage account.",0
"I don't see where to open one in our online in our business BAC account portal and if our BAC biz rep wasn't a ghost I'd ask him.  Anyway if you Google ""Merrill Edge Self-Directed Business Investor Account"", known as a BIA account, it will return a pdf of terms/application as one of the search results that you can download.  This is literally the only thing I can find online but at least indicates the account type exists.  There is a phone number for help with the form of 877-653-4732 that I will eventually get around to calling.

Don't bother opening a BAC savings account expecting any better i-rates, you will be disappointed.  I only see value in having a linked Merrill brokerage account where we can move money into a money market fund, even then I doubt Merrill would make it seamless based on my personal accounts experience.

I have a personal BAC checking with a linked personal brokerage account at Merrill to transfer funds back and forth due to BAC's notoriously low i-rates.  Using BAC/Merrill has had other benefits such as their cash back cc where you can, with account balance bonuses, get 2.625% cash back on ALL purchases.  I can tell you the Merrill brokerage interface is behind the times but I have gotten very used to the BAC interface, especially for business.  I only keep money in there to qualify for the bonus tiers, I use other brokerage accounts for most of my investing.",0
"I don't know actually, I thought it looks like thinkorswim, so I am just try to ask",0
"FrontRunning. 

Arguably how 'Free Trade' apps like Robin Hood (and possibly FreeTrade) make they money.

Front-running is trading stock by a broker who has inside knowledge of a future transaction that is about to affect its price substantially.

Say a broker gets an order from a  client to buy 1 shares of a company.  The broker sets aside the request for a minute and first buys some that share for their own personal portfolio at a cheaper price than you've ordered. Then the client's order is put through. The broker immediately sells the 'cheaper' share and pockets the difference.",0

"For her to open an account in her name, she would have to be 18.

Now, there are custodial accounts that can be opened with you as the custodian and her as the ""minor"" or ""beneficiary"" depending on what type of account you open. 

However, these accounts have very strict rules and are more of a headache than I think is really worth it. Custodial accounts are for the minor and once those funds go in there, they belong to the minor and cannot be used by anyone else or for anything other than the benefit of the minor.

And to take withdrawals from it, you either have to submit proof that the funds are being used for the benefit of minor or you can get a checkbook (this is the best way due to the fact that Merrill does not have to obtain proof) 

Personally, I would recommend you opening a normal CMA account in your name and letting her deposit funds in it and teach her about brokerage accounts until she is 18. After she turns 18, she can open an account in her name and you can easily have everything in the account transferred to her new account. 

Or, of course, she can wait until she is 18 and open an account then. 


I will also note to NEVER tell Merrill or a Financial Service Representative that your daughter is accessing the account in any way while it is in your name. That is considered friendly fraud and merrill will lock your user id and make you change it to a new ID and have you say that you understand to not share the login with anyone.

"If you have short puts and long stock, the long stock doesn't cover the short puts.  Short stock would cover the short puts.  By being long stock and being short puts, you are increasing your risk compared to just holding one position or the other.  Not saying this is bad, but your description of your risk is wrong.  Or maybe you mean you could sell your stock to come up with the cash to cover assignment on your puts.

In terms of cash management while shorting options, I find it helpful to think of 3 baskets - cash, long stock, and short options.  You can buy things like stocks, bonds, money markets, etc until you run out of cash.  You can continue buying things beyond that, but you will be taking a margin loan and paying interest.  At the same time you can sell options (assuming the correct account permissions).  The short options will bring cash into your account.  It's up to you to balance the overall risk in your portfolio between long stock and short options plays.  I also find it helpful to keep some cash in something like SWVXX that I can sell to cover any losses on short options (you have to spend cash to buy back a short option that doesn't expire worthless).

In terms of seeing how much cash you have available, you can look at 'cash and sweep vehicle' in TOS.  You might have to add that field.  That amount is how much cash you have left to buy things with before you start incurring margin interest.  If it's negative, you're getting charged margin interest.  This typically matches a field that Schwab shows, but if you have any margin interest charges for the month those will be deducted from the balance Schwab shows (but not the TOS balance). When you have unsettled trades, you just have to keep a mental tally of what those trades will do to your cash balance when they settle.  So for example, I tend to sweep proceeds from selling puts into SWVXX until I get enough to buy something else with it.  As I sell puts, my cash and sweep vehicle number will go up by the amount I collected for the puts.  At the end of the day, I'll put in an order to buy SWVXX for whatever I sold my puts for.  That trade will execute overnight, and both trades will settle the next day.",0

Fidelity doesn’t treat their MMFs like mutual funds. If I sell a position in my brokerage account there it immediately goes into SPAXX (MMF) and I can buy something else if I choose. If I buy another (higher yielding) MMF it doesn’t get executed until market close so that adds a day. But once that MMF order executes I can immediately deploy those funds and buy something else.

Remove the word 'guarantee' from your vernacular. There are no guarantees in investing, only probabilities.

The 10% per year figure you're referencing is taken from *hundreds* of years of historical data - not one. It can only be applied on the assumption that you stay invested and continue to invest for a long enough time period to ride out the volatility of the markets. 1-2 years is not long term. It does not allow enough time for compounding to work effectively.

The statistical probability that you will make a net loss from consistent contributions is almost eradicated around the 5 year mark, but not an impossibility.

This is the reason why many people say 5 years should be a *barest* minimum, but to see the best results you should have a much, much longer time horizon.",0

No advisor suggested that I do that. I didn't even have one 30 some years ago.

It's just how I setup my income when I was working and used the routing number and my account number to set up auto pay to have my bills debited from my individual taxable account. I did have a Fidelity advisor help me with liquidating some positions to have money for a down payment for a house and sustain me easily for a year when I was planning on retiring as the Federal Government takes awhile for you to start receiving your pension checks (took five months) but he's gone to a different position with Fidelity so he's no longer my advisor so I have a new one but he really hasn't done anything for me as I'm not needing any help at the moment. I think I need to go to a tax strategist to see about converting my rollover IRA to my Roth. I'm not sure that a Fidelity advisor can help me with that but I'll ask him since they've been calling me to set up an appointment with him.

We’re actively working to add more functionality as quickly as possible. As this is a beta, some features planned for the final product aren’t available just yet.

Here’s what you should know about self-directed RESPs during early access:

- Accounts will only be available on our web trading platform at first. You can open this new account by selecting “Add an account” > “Investing” > “Self-directed RESP account”.

- Clients in British Columbia and Quebec can open self-directed RESPs, but provincial education savings grants (BCTESG and QESI) aren’t supported just yet. You're welcome to open an account now, but you'll miss out on these grants, and we can't apply them retroactively. If these grants are important to you, we recommend waiting until we've integrated them (we're working on it).

This means each RESP can have multiple beneficiaries (children who'll benefit from the savings), but only one account owner (typically a parent or guardian). Individual plans and joint ownership aren't available in the beta yet, but we're working on expanding our offerings.

Can you survive and practice a process like the one you mentioned, which I agree with, so you could be around in the future to take advantage of market opportunities, which in return create value. Initially, I assess the previous volatility, and set a maximum stoploss of 30% below Palantir price. An entry point just above a support level where the price is likely to bounce.

"I bought Disney like 3 years ago and it's still down about 60%. Agree or disagree, but Disney chose the wrong side of the American ""culture wars"" argument in the eyes of the American public.

"Citadel used to be the main/only market maker around a few years ago. Now there's a bunch of market makers and a ton of competition. Robinhood lists out their top market makers, and Citadel has been pushed down by other firms. It's still on the list since brokers are legally required to go to the market maker that has the lowest price, but it's not dominant anymore. Keep in mind that Robinhood's relationship with Citadel was always an informal customer relationship, not a formal business partnership. 

The reason why I always talk up Robinhood is because they get so much unfair hate online. They're the cheapest/best broker, but got a ton of blame for stuff out of their hands. That's what always happens to disruptive innovators. The existing industry does everything possible to discredit them. I don't buy into conspiracies, but Fidelity led the latest investing round in Reddit and has its own official sub here.",0
Fidelity actually has lower expense ratios on popular index funds than Vanguard. So be careful about that. We’ve had accounts with Fidelity for over 20 years and have never once had a problem. People usually have problems when they have done something wrong. But that isn’t common for investors who put money into mutual funds or ETFs long term.  I’d suggest FXAIX to start.,0
"I know people who retired to Malaysia, JB, KL and Penang. But most of them have a way to get visa because one spouse is Malaysian. It's going to be hard to get a visa otherwise, the mm2h requirements are a bit onerous and the alternative of making frequent trip in and out is somewhat up to the mercy of immigration. 

2 of them did eventually come back to sg because of old age and healthcare plus easier for kids and grand kids to take care of them. But prior to that was retired in JB for like 10+ years or more. 

So yeah feasible but you'll need a way to get that visa to stay there.",0

So far from what I’ve heard is it’s the same sort of hesitation from banks, quite surprising that they don’t seem to understand us, not like we are risking any of their float. 

I think someone has to come up with full stack solution for traders, last year or so I’ve worked on full integration with accounting software like zoho books etc, just figuring out this part & really not going anywhere. 

My issue with BVI or Estonia is that they have significant compliance checks now, they don’t let you open the IBKR account unless you have some ties or massive compliance teams. Moreover this part of banks seeing our P&L is important for me to get into some real estate in parallel.  

Maybe the next billion dollar startup idea indeed is to come with a full prop trader stack…",0

"You're basically saying that a Toyota should get bad Trustpilot reviews because a BMW is faster on the road. There isn't a single thing that Freetrade markets that it doesn't deliver flawlessly.

I keep 20 percent in SCHD and the rest in money market. It's in my Merrill Edge account. It's worked well so far. I like the fact I can get cash quickly if needed.,0
"A lot of those it's going to be difficult to get a fill for just $1k. IBKR doesn't make it easy to see, but if you search those Cusip's on another platform such as Fidelity, it'll show you the minimum quantity to get filled at the ask. Depending on what it is I've seen it anywhere from $1k to $250k.

Market makers generally won't fill small orders because the commission has too big of an impact. If another retail trader is selling then that's when you might get a fill for $1k. Although if you ever want to sell it later you'd have the same issue selling as you did buying.",0
"For now, I’m keeping what I have in Fidelity. I still have my direct deposit in another bank and my emergency funds at another. It wasn’t simple process moving retirement accounts and I think would end up paying taxes on capital gains if I move my taxable brokerage account. Also, these issues are mainly CMA and/or if you’re using taxable brokerage for cash flow. Thankfully, I haven’t moved my direct deposit and my emergency fund when these issues started. I’m still hoping things will get back to normal soon. If it does not, I will move my funds to Schwab or Vanguard in January 2025.",0

"That's correct. So it's not protected by a guarantee like FCFS. Which protects you no matter what, maybe except the case when the government itself has failed ( very unlikely in the case of a country like the UK.

In any case you don't have to worry about your broker like Freetrade failing. You are not investing in Freetrade, you are investing via Freetrade. 

All that said any investment has an inherent risk. As backing assets's value may go down. For example if a company goes bankrupt and you own its stock, stock goes to zero and you'll lose everything.",0
">How do we (me and the IRS) ""know"" it is non-deductible? Is it just that I don't deduct it on my 1040?

You complete form 8606

>Also I read an article that advised to wait a month between making the non-deductible traditional IRA contribution and converting it to a Roth, so that there is an account trail that shows the flow. I mean I guess, but isn't that all tracked already?

No waiting is required. 

>Anyway, what about gain/loss in whatever length of time it is in the traditional IRA before converting? Does that need to be accounted for? And if so, is it cleaner to open an additional traditional IRA account just for this type of rollover? I can imagine I would be doing this conversion yearly going forward.

You would ideally convert cash. If you convert more than your contribution, the amount in excess of the contribution is taxable as income. Most people get this in the form of residual interest waiting for the deposit to the traditional IRA to settle. Opening a separate account is irrelevant to the process as the IRS views all owned pretax IRAs as one single account. 

If you have existing traditional IRA balances, you need to read up on the pro rata rule.",0
"I think you may wish to use the virtual portfolio first and do some research on the different terms in eToro. 

Firstly, the “change” column is what I believe to be the change % of the price for the day. Nothing to do with your portfolio. This is simply open value vs current price or close price if past market close. 

Secondly, you placed a market order which means you’ll buy at the current price in the market. You also need to be aware of market speed which is the difference between selling and buying prices which differ to the market price of the shares. Think of a buyer seller type of deal when buying a car, neither price is the value of the car.

Thirdly, research limit orders and stop loss. 

Limit order when buying: the purchase will only trigger when the price drops to the desired price (don’t use it to buy at a higher price please).

Stop loss: use it to stop losses. Really this is up to you and your risk appetite but my own strategy is a long view trader and never buy to short the stock. So I buy a stock I think is going to go up and I leave it. It may go down or up. I just ignore it. When the stock gets to a position I am happy with an want to protect, I put a stop loss in place but I leave a decent gap to allow for temporary market volatility but if there is a permanent drop due to a bear market (basically what we all experienced over the last two weeks), then it will trigger a sale and protect my profits and then it allows me to monitor and enter at a point I believe is the lower point before a bull market starts again. 

Do your research and come up with a strategy. Don’t try and play both sides is my advice but it is up to you.",0
You have to consider CGT with UK stocks as well there isn’t an exemption there either. For US stocks there is a FX charge / conversion rate as well. I have a GIA account with FreeTrade because I have a separate stocks and shares ISA elsewhere.,0

"Like annual yields? 

If annual try junk bonds and other corporate fixed income. Companies being restructured after being acquired as well offer very high interest for their debt. Is it 500k in cash or cash equivalents? Just buy US debt obligations with the remaining cash to hedge against market risk. Bond market value normally increase when the stock market goes up as investors flock to riskier assets. 

Derivatives. Interest rate swaps also deliver good income and are a hedge. I love derivatives. But for now, just interest rate swaps or commodity futures. I’d say oil is always a good and stable investment but now it isn’t as much. Still very stable, but the sector is going through change. 

Hedging the sectors you’re investing in as well. Certain sectors are more elastic to changes in the economy than others. If I’m investing in a coffee company, I’ll want to hedge by buying covered puts, where you only pay the premium if it expires. Regular calls too if you’re bullish on a stock and may want to buy more in the long run. 

Just remember, this is reddit not a financial advisor lol, but this is what I’d do and I’m not rich or anything like that, in fact the opposite",0
Your employer’s deal with Fidelity may require a certain 401k value to allow you to keep it there because they likely pay admin fees to Fidelity . Why not roll it into an IRA regardless?,0
"I just wanted to add, the margin requirements might be \~150% of the actual price of the Stock.

Meaning to keep the position open, you might need MORE than the initial purchase price, or they will just auto-liquidate your position.

I am unsure if this applies to a Cash account.  But a penny Stock on the ASX is likely considered very high-risk by IBKR and they might want that cushion of safety

">Does Merrill Edge have similar funds to Fidelity's SPAXX or SPRXX that are fee free and yield 5%+ monthly payout?

Yes. See their rate sheet, which is updated frequently. Page 2 lists many money market mutual funds that can be purchased. [https://olui2.fs.ml.com/Publish/Content/application/pdf/GWMOL/ICCRateSheet.pdf](https://olui2.fs.ml.com/Publish/Content/application/pdf/GWMOL/ICCRateSheet.pdf)

>could I invest the majority of my CMA balance into T-bills?

Sure.

>$368 into a FEE FREE fund.

The listed funds have no transaction fees to buy/sell, but virtually all mutual funds, including money markets, have fees expressed as expense ratios, with the quoted 7-day yield being after expenses.

>manually reinvest the money earned on the interest the month prior. Is this correct?

If you have purchased a money market fund, its dividends will be automatically reinvested into the fund. At least for TTTXX and I assume the others. As was mentioned, money in a money market fund must be liquidated to cash before it can be used elsewhere. Uninvested cash earns a low interest rate.

>TMCXX, POIXX, LEFXX, FISXX, and TTTXX. Which one is optimal?

They each have trade-offs. Some have state tax exemption. Some have higher yield but are subject to state tax. Some have equivalent yield, but different settlement times, which you can see once you have an account. Some have floating NAV, so some fluctuation in value. TTTXX is known to be good overall and is state tax exempt. In a no-tax state, you might find a better option.",0
"Buddy, I am finished with this conversation, good luck.  I know what the rules are for a margin acount with IBKR.",0
"It's not been possible to contribute to more than one of the same kind of ISA before. This will change in April though, so I'm looking forward to it.

I avoid interest as much as possible at the moment because the allowance is low and I don't really want to pay the higher rate tax on anything above it. So I've been juggling it around as best as I can outside of that.",1
its the same with its desktop and TWS apps .. how the heck do these guys even claim they are better than robinhood or webull?,1
"This is pretty much what i have as well. But i have not had terrible experience at fidelity yet, so i am sticking there as well.",1
"Im here since the blip (april 2020). Zero issues withdrawaing, 0 issues with trade executions, 0 issues with pricing, 0 issues with support, etc. Etoro is a good broker, I would recommend.",1
"you can't just judge by trading fees, because the execution price would be different from platform to platform. Robinhood is PFOF(Payment for order flow). You should test it yourself to see which platform gives you the net overall better prices. a lot of times PFOF gets worse execution, but you must test for yourself.

For margin, for 300k margin here is the comparison I see:  
Robinhood  
5.75% for 50k + 5.55% for 50k + 5.25% for 200k = $16,125  
IBKR  
5.83% for 100k + 5.33% for 200k = $16,490  
so in terms of margin robinhood is $365 better. but to be fair robinhood gold costs $50 per year, so the savings is actually $315 better for robinhood.

IBKR has a lot of great features/order types/access to global markets etc. that robinhood doesn't have. As well as it is a safer broker.",1
Ideally there are no fees when you’re transacting in your accounts.  You can avoid this by sticking with Fidelity funds and others labeled as no transaction fee.  In general there aren’t many fees that you’d be paying and there is no standard monthly transaction fee for a self managed account,1

Definitely worth it if you're just using TOS for technical analysis.",1
"What are you talking about? What middle finger?

The company doesn't practice payment-for-order-flow and still tries to offer free transactions (to the average everyday investor). What more do you want? I think people should be a little bit more grateful. Before freetrade and trading212, each transaction was around £10 !!

1/ Is it easy to use? Yes, very easy, I'm starting on the stock market and IBRK is my first broker. I don't regret my choice at all. For the slightly ""complex"" parts, I used tutorials on YouTube.

2/ Easy to finance your account? Yes very easy.

3/ Automatic form? I don't know the form you are talking about but I automatically received the forms for French residents (tax reduction in Ireland and tax reduction for investments in the USA).

4/ I defined my currency in euros. But you can change at any time + convert your currencies at any time without necessarily changing your base currency. Both are possible.

5/ As a French citizen (European Union), it is impossible to buy American ETFs which do not comply with UCITS regulations. So I buy SP 500 domiciled in Ireland and whose replication quality is superior to ETFs domiciled in the USA, because we are not reduced by the 15% US tax.

6/ IRA/ROTH? I don't know what this is about, sorry.

7/ Do I recommend? Yes, very much so. Much more than Trade Republic for example (in Germany)",1
"Yeah, you’re right—TOS (under Schwab now) used to have a bit of an edge on fees, but lately they’re pretty close to IB, especially for options. Schwab has $0 commission on stocks, but still charges $0.65 per options contract, which is pretty standard now.

That said, you don’t *have* to be locked into TOS for trading. A lot of traders stick with brokers like IB (for fills or global access) and just use **ThinkOrSwim for charting, analysis, scanning, and strategy work**. You can trade wherever fees and execution are best for you—and still keep all the tools ToS offers on the side.

[Here’s a guide if you want to set that up without a full Schwab trading account.](https://thinkorswim-europe.medium.com/how-to-get-a-real-thinkorswim-account-without-quotes-delays-for-non-us-residents-294b4722697f)

So yeah—pick the broker that works best for your trading, and use ToS for everything else.",1
"This would be great. I imagine being able to upload charitable receipts, medical receipts, etc during the year as you get them. And then maybe at year-end the AI can transcribe the data into the tax forms.",1
"Looks like a lot of fake reviews from foreign countries (Wealthsimple is only available in Canada), always suggesting a different platform.  So spam reviews basically. 

It’s a highly regulated market in Canada, and Wealthsimple is a member of the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) and  accounts are protected by the Canadian Investor Protection Fund (CIPF). Seems pretty safe to me",1
Im so frustrated with Schwab.  So horrible platform.  I have been using TDameritrade all my life so in love why would the hell hot bought out… anyone please tell me other platform similar to TDameritrade…. Thanks million ,1
"No offense but if you can’t spend $40/yr for a 4.1%  rate, 3.5% ira match, reduced commissions and level 2 data transferring brokerages isn’t gonna do much for you. Lvl 2 data starts at $3/mo for the most basic package. 

My annual fee was covered in two days from the 4.1% and would have been covered in an hour if I transferred my IRA in. My IRA is currently with RH so I will be transferring it into Webull. I trade webull because of the UI so if you enjoy that part of it I would recommend staying. RH made me lose a lot more money on options slippage and auto liquidation of options at 3:30.",1
"I posted that before hoping that maybe they would restart the app. It really wouldn’t cost anything to do it and it would keep some old TD customers very happy. 
I will be leaving Schwab if they don’t bring it back because their watchlist was extraordinarily handy to use.",1
"Okay, I’ll give you my thoughts, I love TDA - their platforms, especially TOS and customer service too. If I have any cons it’s that they don’t do fractional shares. 
My accounts haven’t yet migrated to Schwab, but I did open a Schwab account essentially to test it out, since they were offering a promo for new accounts. Their platform is meh, but they allow for fractional shares, which makes investing the same amount each month easy, so that’s a pro. Customer service at Schwab is decent- although people here have shared here that they’ve been less than happy with their experience, that has not been my experience. I’ve had an easy time resolving issues w/them. Another pro. I’ll likely stick with schwab mostly because TOS will still be available.
TDA is far superior to active trade. Some of my friends who’s accounts migrated from TDA have lost access to TOS- they’ve been told they’ll have access eventually…

Have you tried reaching out to fidelity sub here? They are very prompt and helpful.",1
"Here are the services that I cannot find in webull but ibkr has, bond(tbill), fx pair trading, event betting, currency conversion, portfolio margin, and prime broker.

For product features, webull has the surface area for retail traders, but not for robust & high value traders, they are lack behind. For example, a covered call in ibkr can be done in 1 order(long 100 shares + short call), but I try around in webull, I can't seem to find that. In addition to that, webull didn't offer portfolio margin or prime broker account to high value traders. Could be webull's target audiences are retail traders, but not the high value day traders.

Overall, I say webull is a great broker and have many great tools, and improvements on products and features still needed, especially on for those high value clients' features.",1
The Fidelity options are excellent - great user interface too. (I don't work for them - just a fan.) Best wishes - hope you have fun things to spend it on in 20 years!,1
"Love Freetrade and have my ISA with them, just really wish Limit Orders and Stop Losses came as standard. I understand Freetrade is designed towards long term investing but do feel these are pretty basic trading features to lock behind Plus. 

Saying that I have considered jumping to Plus for the extra stocks and 3% interest as well as unlocking those extra features!",1
"Just had my brokerage account moved to Schwab.  I considered myself a ""power user"" of the TD Ameritrade website.   Unfortunately, the first trading day on Schwab today was....rough.   LOTS of little things missing on Schwab that I took for granted on the TD site.   However, the trades themselves went smoothly and without issue.

I just don't understand why they ditched the superior website.  Corporation logic at it's finest...

Thankfully, Think or Swim is coming to Schwab ""later this year"".   I was never a power user of Think or Swim....but I think I will give it a shot once it arrives on Schwab.",1

"What is HYSA?  
I always had a good opinion on Etoro. When you read about Trading212 which is amazing from the interest rate they pay, there are a lot of problems. I thought Etoro is better.  
Interactive Broker, I really have troubles with their interface. Not good for me, while I love Etoro.",1
"I'm looking for another app to transfer to as I'm not happy having to leave tdameritrade. Not webull, not hood, and I don't like using fidelity",1
It’s free.  You have to pay sec fees when trading options but that’s it. Merrill is great. I’ve used several brokers and they are the best I’ve ised,1
"The learning page in the app has give me extensive canadian tax knowledge. Like pros and cons with regards to rrsp/tfsa/fhsa. Community is also a cool feature i like where i can share info with other investors. 

Also, im a huge fan of moomoo figurines. I even bought some off ebay to add to my collection. Please release more",1
My opinion is it is decent has a lot of things there but not like TOS. SSE has lagged a lot for me but been fine other than that which shouldn’t happen. Their mobile app is missing a lot of things. I still don’t get why people don’t think schwab has a lot of cons even though they are a decent main broker. They’ve been going down hill for about 1.5-2 years now IMO.,1
"Spot-on. Let's also face facts that the average retail user who isn't looking to trade often is going to find TOS too complex with too high a learning curve. The TD app is far more intuitive, too, and losing that is going to seriously hurt someone trying to get accustomed to Schwab's garbage or feeling forced to try to like TOS.",1
"Robinhood hired a bunch of TDA people after Schwab acquired TDA. I like TDA, Schwab, Fidelity, and Vanguard for different purposes, but Robinhood is the best now. It has the best app, 1% match on 401k and IRA transfers/contributions, better trade execution than Interactive Brokers (according to a UC-Irvine study), 24/5 trading on individual stocks, commission free stock, options, and crypto trades, and a much less scammy business model than Schwab (in my opinion). 

Special note: Fidelity's app is one of the worst apps I've ever used. They've tried to copy Robinhood and it's been a disaster for several years now.

"So i love the application after hours of learning how to use it. IBKR academy and youtube are your best friends.  That said;  
When you have mutliple accounts and you sell out on one position you get a bug on the total ammount you currently have based on market price which drive sme nuts.   
the aggragate is wrong individual is ok, phone app shows the right number.   


the tickers that you dont just let me stack them upsets me because i havent seen any app that makes me do that don't really understand why or why you haven't decrease the price for that .  the fact that you dont have a way to include the earnings like trading view makes me sad because you have done with splits and dividends.   


The fact that you only let me go back 7 days of trades whyyy. i dont get it .

i would love a bundle that gives me everything without having to think of what market data is or is not or should be just make it a standard price for all of it would be amazing but unrealistic! i know. 

let me draw on the charts anyway i want. haaaaaa i want to draw the tealeaves! :P  


i dont know hot to put moneyness in the options chain makes me mad!  


You guys are the best so far that i have found to meet all my investing trading needs. sometimes it just feel you wanna spend time with the new baby more than the grown ass man. phone app more than tws. but he has a lot of potential also.   


also give me access to economic data to chart im not sure if i can do taht :D ,ucho love guys, im complaining but im still a devoted cultist so its ok!",1
"I would love to share your optimism.

Freetrade does charge for services, Freetrade Plus, ISA, SIPP. That is their model, give the basic for free charge subscription fees for additional stuff. If that isn't working lending out shares that don't belong to them isn't in retail investors best interest.

Freetrade doesn't hold your shares they are held by a custodian, yes they are regulated by UK / US regulators respectively, however neither Freetrade nor Drivewealth (whom Freetrade ""buy"" US shares), can give me evidence my shares have been brought. They can only say if the app says it has then it has. No note of who the share was brought from, no ability to transfer the share without cashing it out. It is in an account held by a custodian which I cannot access or even view. I can only see what the app shows me with no way to verify. If they offered in specie transfers (transfers without having to sell the shares for cash and transferring the cashing), or if they allowed direct registration rather than a custodial account, then I might have more faith they own the shares I have brought. Until then I can only hope they aren't IOUs.",1
"1. Debit card is pretty good for atm fee rebate. Credit not so much
2. If you open a brokerage account you’ll also open a Schwab bank account which are separate. Pretty much operates like any other bank except for accepting no cash.

"trade futures.

"The ability to do most all of your financial tasks at one place is appealing. I like that Fidelity will auto sell a money market fund if it’s needed to fund a stock purchase. At Schwab, that is not the case. The Fidelity web and app user experience is easy to understand after using it for a few weeks. Anyone will feel some frustration changing to a different platform as it’s unfamiliar. I find Fidelity to be one of the better designs. I appreciate how they integrate quickly and easily with most local banks if you want to push/pull money. Fidelity uses electronic signatures for most account setups. They have many low fee or no fee options for investing. If you’re a low-cost index investor, the fees are the same between any of the brokerages; it comes down to user experience and customer service experience. I also like how they have responded to feedback and suggestions I’ve made over the years. They called me a week after making a suggestion to fully understand what I was asking for on their platform. They were very responsive. When a relative passed away and I was tasked with handling their estate, Fidelity did a good job walking me through what needed to be done and it went smoothly.

Their education series, webinars, videos, and guides are all well done. They have monthly education that you can watch live or a replay on topics of interest. For people with a decent level of assets, you’ll have access to a local Fidelity representative. Mine is a CFP with other additional credentials. They have helped me think through some financial paths and estate planning. They would probably like it if I asked them to manage my accounts, but have never pushed it, only mentioned it. We meet a couple times a year at their local office or over video chat.

A couple suggestions. Open a brokerage account and skip the cash management account. Brokerage account will pay more on uninvested cash sitting in the account by a percentage point or two. Read about the differences (it’s been posted numerous times on Reddit). Cash Management Account helps some people by reimbursing ATM fees, where you have to have more assets in the brokerage account to get the same benefit. If starting all over, I’d skip the CMA and just do a brokerage account with Fidelity. You could some money over and use their platform for a few weeks to be sure you’re comfortable before moving it all.

Best wishes for a successful investing journey.",1

"I think it's a good move for Moomoo to follow up with their customers since some people might find investment platforms a bit tricky to understand.

"Agree, I've been with free-trade for 1.5 years now. I really want to support them and have been as a premium user since it came out.

I just feel like they are behind on so many aspects when comparing to other trading platforms that the only thing stopping me from changing now is that trading 212 are incredibly slow with approving documentation ATM.

Hey atleast freetrade is improving every month.",1
"I have both the Charles Schwab and Fidelity cards (employer changed brokerages). The Charles Schwab has a significantly better user experience, but the Fidelity has a better return at 2%. If I could do it all over again I would have gotten the fidelity right off of the bat and transferred my funds money periodically",1
"I agree with you. I love all Fidelity features again, but I don’t like how they handle the situations lately anyway. Since you’re so involved with Fidelity, why are you still using the old greedy bank? Then why don’t you direct deposit your money to Fidelity and avoid the hustles of the transfer if you don’t mind me asking?

To me, it’s not worth the hustle for monthly spending and money management, and it’s best to separate my banking from the investment. There are too many free online banking options that you could choose from, or credit unions that could serve you well and not rely on one financial institution.",1
"I totally agree, i like the freetrade user interface and find it much nicer to use. 

But i liked the FTX user interface and well that didnt work out well.

"I wonder what's the OP intention behind posting this. 

There is no perfect balance between making it intuitive vs educational in Options trading. I ignore most as it takes too much time investment to understand.

In my case, I guess I'd be at break-even with Options on IBKR in last 6 months of trading them ( I use WS to look up prices, and buy Calls on IBKR). 

WS being a new player have to be comprehensive in the features they offer to be on par with Big Banks. Atleast they are not going to the level of Cue the Confetti levels of Robinhood.

"Fellow traders,

I have achieved working ToS on Win 7 again. Fuck Schwab so much. A virtual OS is required unless the fucktards at Schwab release a fix or we can get some Extended Kernel support but at least now I'm bulletproof from their fuckery.

\- VMWare seems like the option for best performance. Supposedly v15 works on Win 7 but I kept running into errors with Visual C++. v14.1.8 worked without any problem. That can be found here: [https://softwareupdate.vmware.com/cds/vmw-desktop/ws/](https://softwareupdate.vmware.com/cds/vmw-desktop/ws/)

\- Next you need Win 10 LTSC which can be found here: [https://massgrave.dev/windows\_ltsc\_links](https://massgrave.dev/windows_ltsc_links)

\- After that I needed to allow my bios to allow virtualization which was called SVM in the advanced bios settings on my motherboard (VMWare prompted me to do this, you may not need to)

\- If you want multiple monitors, download VMware ""tools"" from within the virtual machine: https://packages.vmware.com/tools/releases/12.5.0/windows/x64/. Then shut down the computer, make the display changes with the virtual computer off. Finally use ""VMWareResolutionSet.exe"" to specify the size and position of the other monitors: [https://superuser.com/questions/680841/possible-to-have-multiple-virtual-monitors-for-a-vmware-guest-in-windowed-mode](https://superuser.com/questions/680841/possible-to-have-multiple-virtual-monitors-for-a-vmware-guest-in-windowed-mode)

\- Finally to bring over your workspace FROM the host to the same location on the guest (virtual machine): C:\\Users\\\[YOUR USERNAME\]\\AppData\\Local\\thinkorswim via a Shared Folder (you can create this in the VM settings)

"There are better options out there that would generate much more significant returns then lending out stocks or whatever assets you own. 

Wealthsimple makes tons of money as it is why lend out an asset you worked hard to buy?",1
"Smart of you to think this through - when your timeline is short (like under 2 years), **capital preservation matters more than growth**.

The general rule: if you need the money soon (e.g. for a house deposit), it’s safer to **move it out of high-volatility assets** like stocks. Even something like the S&P500 can dip 10–20% in a heartbeat - and that could seriously delay your plans.

You don’t have to sell everything overnight, but gradually shifting into **cash or low-risk savings/investments** (like a high-interest savings account, money market fund, or fixed-rate ISA) might make more sense.

You’ve done the hard part - saving. Now protect it. It’s not about “missing out” - it’s about locking in the future you’re building.",0
"Yes! 😁 It is a lot faster and I find it SAFER and a better option than EFTs now.. You set up the transfer process via your online banking portal (not the app) it would be under bank to bank transfers or external transfers. Unlike an EFT.. the money is debited by my bank for the transaction IMMEDIATELY when initiated and the transfer takes my bank 1-3 days standardly but since I was told about the method, I've had my deposits (from 50-700) transfer from my bank to my CMA same day and clear for withdrawal and trade when it's received. 

I suggest if you can't set up external ACHs on your own, contact your local branch to help you out..

Just make sure you’re comfortable managing that many, though. It can get tricky keeping up with each one, especially if you want to stay on top of news and trends. The two grand a month dedicated to investing is a solid plan; it’s all about finding that balance between having enough exposure while still being able to follow your portfolio without it becoming overwhelming.

"Yeah, all I know about it is that last year both Chase and Fidelity got hit really hard by tons of people committing check fraud. 

So now limiting people’s mobile deposits to $1,000 and holding mobile deposits and even “pull transfers” for 3 weeks has been Fidelity’s way of “mitigating fraud”. 

But not everyone seems to be affected by these restrictions. I’m not sure how they’re deciding whose accounts get the restrictions and whose don’t. 

I’m by no means “new” to Fidelity. I’ve had accounts with them for 10 years but even I’m getting the restrictions on my accounts. 🤦‍♂️

But the restrictions don’t affect me much. I use Fidelity for savings/retirement…Fidelity is not my main “bill pay account” like it is for some people.",
"I'll be off-ramping from eToro in a few months. They have launched some investment on their funds with a 100% guaranteed return on capital (I think it started last year?) as long as you hold it for at least a year. That's a bright red flag for me. My guess is, they need liquidity. The yield curve is about to invert (or has already) and usually, a recession happens some time after. I'm betting on that happening this year and expecting a massive one. Brokers like eToro need cash if people start panicking and withdraw their funds. I want to cash out before that happens. Those who invested in the 100% guaranteed capital BS will become the bag holders. I won't be surprised if cases like yours start ramping up. I've already read about their terrible customer service and some accounts being closed down. At some point, some of these brokers will collapse. You can guess which ones if you read the number of grievances on X and Reddit. If anyone is thinking of using eToro, don't. Stay away from them.",0
"MyMerrill is for wealth management clients.  They may have combined your accounts and kept you under MyMerrill since they probably collect fees there unlike Merrill Edge which is for all BAC clients.

No, when trading in a cash account you need to avoid free-riding and good-faith violations. [Schwab explains what these are on their web site.](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/avoid-these-violations-when-trading-cash)",0
You don’t have a TD account anymore. You have a Schwab account you haven’t accessed yet.  Got schwaballiance.com and try to login.  There should be a “call us” option when you get stuck.

"This is absolutely incorrect and I have never experienced this issue on any other trade platform besides WealthSimple. The basis is actually pretty straightforward:

\- There are two spouses with RRSPs, one is an individual RRSP with one contributor and the same contributor is the same annuitant of the individual RRSP.  
\- The other spouse has a spousal RRSP, where they are the annuitant and both their spouse and themselves are the contributor. Effectively, this RRSP has two contributors.  
\- For math's sake, let's say each spouse is able to contribute $10,000/year to their RRSPs.  
\- Spouse 1, with the individual RRSP, contributes $5,000 to their individual RRSP. They then contribute $5,000 to the spouse's RRSP as the contributor, which is *deducted from their total contribution allotment*. Spouse 1 no longer has any funds to contribute to either RRSP.  
\- Spouse 2 contributes their full $10,000 to their spousal RRSP, noted in the contribution that the annuitant is the contributor, not the spouse. This spouse has effectively had $15,000 contributed to their RRSP, while the first spouse has had $5,000 contributed to theirs. ***Only the annuitant is able to take money from this spousal RRSP, and there has been no ""double-dipping"" in this instance***.

In this exact scenario it doesn't make sense as the amounts are equal, but in real life the first spouse would make more money than the second spouse, therefore having a higher RRSP contribution limit. Let's say spouse 1 can contribute $20,000 and spouse 2 can contribute $10,000. Spouse 1 puts $15,000 in their account, and $5,000 in the spousal account as contributor. Spouse 2 puts $10,000 in the spousal account as contributor. Effectively, while both contribution limits have been used up, each spouse now has an equal $15,000 amount in their RRSPs to pull from in retirement. It makes for equal income pulling and reduced incoming taxes in retirement where one spouse makes more than the other during their employment years.

**This is the whole purpose of a Spousal RRSP, so the two spouses have relatively equal RRSPs in retirement, in order to have equal retirement income, even though they had an income disparity while employed.** While not allowing the annuitant to contribute to the spousal RRSP doesn't *completely* nullify the whole purpose of it, as the annuitant can still contribute to their own individual RRSP if they want and eventually pull from 2 RRSPs in the future, it might as well be pointless now because what's the point of having two accounts to pull from... it's just a pain in the ass. Again, **I have never had this issue with any other institution using a Spousal RRSP. It is only WealthSimple.**",-1
"Yes, it's been on Schwab for a long time. And I'm only interested in one thing - why did such a good program like [Think or Swim](https://x.com/i/grok?text=Think%20or%20Swim) turn into a useless bucket of bolts so quickly after [Schwab](https://x.com/i/grok?text=Schwab) took over?",1

"Haha I mean the answer is obvious right? Just save as much as possible, it’s not rocket science, so I was wondering if there were non tangible experiencing or things people felt was worth spending on. Is it such a bad question to ask what kind of priorities other people have? 

A lot of the standard advice in general is geared to get job > make money > save as much as possible > get married > buy home > retirement. But people live their lives in different ways and I was curious to hear if there were people who made money decisions (spending it, saving it) that they felt were worth it. 

I actually got a ton of cool answers here - some were to look at being more social, someone mentioned picking up an instrument. 

Also I dunno about you but financial independence to me is also about how to use my money so that I get the most out of it :)

Plus500 offer the price of the current future's market. At the time of this post in January 2022, the current futures contract is for February. The tradingview image posted is the spot price market and reflects current prices while future prices are not the same thing.

With this said, the futures market that Plus500 show is still not entirely the same as the future markets it is meant to reflect (when it comes to commodities). The moving averages are still in the wrong places and candle formation is still different. Therefore, I think the point remains that commodity trading on Plus500 is a no go.

"Hmm.. you use Chase that might be why? no Fidelity is not a bank, but they are partnered with JP Morgan. Chase is the umbrella they use for liquid/cash reserves, JP Morgan pays us the interest we get on our balances,, not fidelity investments... That's at least what I've gathered. 
Could this be a reason why you have that advantage?? Maybe not.. but I just think it may hold some gravity to you or other JP Morgan account holders, having deposits clear easier than other account holders.. your advice is valuable though, it's the best I've gotten as of recently. Fidelity has been less than helpful and only Full of excuses and apologize. But unlike so many of these people here, I'm not going to let emotions get the best of me and pull all my assets and start elsewhere .. that isn't wise.

"This sounds like a market inversion, the 12month should be higher. 

From Google Bard: 

Interest rates for longer-term bonds are typically higher than those for shorter-term bonds. This is due to a concept called interest rate risk.

Here's the breakdown:

    Longer-term bonds: When you lock your money into a bond for a longer period, you're taking on more risk as you're exposed to potential changes in interest rates over that extended time. To compensate for this risk, these bonds offer a higher coupon rate, which is the annual interest rate they pay.
    Shorter-term bonds: Since they carry less risk, shorter-term bonds usually offer lower coupon rates as investors are willing to accept less for the shorter exposure.

However, it's important to remember that this is a general trend and exceptions can occur. Here are some factors that can influence the relationship between bond maturity and interest rates:

    Market expectations: If the market expects future interest rates to rise, even longer-term bonds might not offer significantly higher rates than shorter-term ones.
    Creditworthiness of the issuer: Bonds issued by governments with strong credit ratings typically offer lower rates than those issued by riskier borrowers, regardless of maturity.
    Liquidity: Shorter-term bonds are generally more liquid, meaning they're easier to buy and sell, which can slightly lower their average interest rates compared to less liquid longer-term bonds.",0

"I have Fidelity, TDA>Schwab and IBKR accounts.

IBKR is nothing like TDA or Fidelity, first you pay for data subscriptions monthly.  Second their customer service is terrible.   Third you either pay commissions on stock trades (IBKR Pro) or you get second-class treatment when it comes to interest on cash/margin rates (IBKR Lite)

IBKR is for sophisticated investors who rarely need help and don't mind paying extra for the services/products that they offer.   The average retail investor (in the US) should steer clear.

As for why I have an account - their commissions on futures trading is much better than TDA/Schwab, Fidelity doesn't even offer futures.",-1
Zero logic behind any policy I’ve seen applied by these people. It honestly seems like the guy who created Robinhood had a significantly dumber brother and decided to open his own brokerage,-1
"I deposited money through a pull transaction on the 10th. Fidelity says the money will clear on the 25th. 15 days is way to long. Also, a lot of banks have limits on external transfers - like 5,000 a day or 30,000 a month. So moving $70,000 with push transactions can take OVER 2 months.

I talked to a Fidelity Investment Adviser before making the transfer and he said nothing about the extended time to clear. I also was not given notice when setting up the transaction online.

Very frustrating.",-1
Their spread on Crypto is very high. Although pulling your money out of Etoro is a 2 day maximum wait and usually happens in like 6 hours. Which is nice.,-1
I agree with this assessment.  Their customer service leaves a lot to be desired.  It is excellent if you know what you want to do and just need a brokerage to do it.,1
"I looked at the yearly returns of the major international stock ETF’s recently.  All of them significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  Further, the two were highly correlated.  When US stocks did poorly, so did international stocks. When US stocks had a good year, international had a better year as well.  I would ditch foreign stocks and go 100 percent into the S&P 500.  Historically, small cap value has performed well.  Yet, the last 10 years’ small cap value and small caps in general have far underperformed the S&P 500.  This is why total market index funds like the Vanguard total Stock market, the S&P 1500, and the Russel 3000 have underperformed the S&P 500.  Keep things simple and just invest in the S&P 500, get great returns and retire much earlier than those putting mixtures of low performing funds together.",-1
"Lots of factors. 1. You're running far too many charts, especially if you have studies on them. Try having just half of them and maybe it'll help. 2. Yesterday was lag hell, days of the highest volatility coincidentally ToS suddenly stops being smooth. 3. Your CPU, ram and wifi or hard wired.

If you make decent money in the market you might as well use the most optimal hardware for trading.",-1
"Looks like a share distribution from BriaPro Therapeutics.

http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/TraderNews.aspx?id=ECA2023-502

Once everything is settled, the symbol should change and the shares should be tradable.",1
I am also out since last year. I had to pull out the money for some bills while I was finding a new job. It’s cool seeing it surging and going up but I’m glad I don’t have to deal with the fees and the stress of all that. Checking the transfer for hours sometimes and days. Even if you make money the gas fees and/or selling fees are so high it almost negates your wins if you’re not careful when you transfer. I also only have faith in BTC. But coinbase never gave me any trouble. Just like WeBull.,1

Microsoft does a rollup when they see fit. I guess they are under no obligation, but clearly they do continue to provide support.

Thanks for recognizing Seniors, imagine if your drive to get out of bed in the morning was taken away because some business stiff took their software away, they didn't think about the customer.  Seniors who do this are wealthy.

"> They're not responding to customer support enquiries and have been purposely vague about the new T&Cs - and the circumstances in which they can carry out their new powers.

I call bullshit on them just ignoring tickets, they can take some time on lower priority tickets. They've also been exceptionally clear on the changes within this email, have they not?

> Personally, I think they're expecting a crash and are afraid of everyone selling (non-meme stocks) and pulling their cash - which would force them into liquidation.

People selling would not force them into liquidation, company operating funds are segregated from client assets. If anything, they'd gain more revenue from FX fees.

>The fact that FSCS only guarantees security on £85k of assets is concerning. If your assets are frozen, three months is a long period of time to have to wait - a lot can happen.

FSCS protects you from bank failures, fraud etc - you're not protected from AML regulations. Again, though, irrelevant due to client asset segregation.

>If you're buying any shares, I'd recommend only buying them in your name from the official broker of the company (ie. Computershare). That's the only guarantee your assets will be secure.

Freetrade has published their security precautions, they're regulated by the FCA and covered by the FSCS guarantee. So that's patently false as well.",-1
"Stocks which commonly swing a high percentage of their value in a day are generally not suitable investment vehicles.   When looking at investing into individual companies, investors typically look for companies with relatively stable underlying financials.  The stock price for these companies are typically stable from day to day and only have wide swings in response to news affecting the company.   And,  as a general rule, they don't enter or exit when the price swings based on company news.

Whether you choose to believe it or not, buy and hold investing is alive and well.   Probably the only difference from 40 years ago is the advent of low cost index funds so many investors are now making choices about which ETF to buy based on market segments instead of individual stocks.  

One other thing about investors.  They also belive in the maxim ""time in the market beats timing the market"".   Generally a trader will believe that they can use lots of data to get a better return by timing their entry and exit.  An investor realizes that in the short term,  stock price movements are hard to predict and largely random.  As a result the investor will ignore the short term movements even entering and exiting and try to get in as soon as possible to capture as much as possible of the long term growth.   Statistically, it's better to enter as soon as possible versus waiting for a downturn which may or may not come.    Lots of studies have shown that lump sum investments beat DCA most of the time.",0
"When you trade on tos , are you using desktop/mobile ? I am looking to exclusively trade desktop with a preference for the platform I use to have hot keys, and an easy user interface. 

I’ve used TOS to exclusively chart since 2019 mainly on desktop , never using the platform to buy/sell . 
I’ve almost 100% used Webull/RH  via mobile to buy/sell  while charting on desktop but want to make a change. 

-When you trade on TOS specifically TOS desktop , do you use hot keys or manually open/close trades ? 

-did you find it difficult to teach yourself how to navigate the platform with  bto/stc positions ? 

-did you use demand to practice ? If so , did you find their simulated trading interface through their demand feature giving you realistic bid/ask spreads and trade results that could be mirrored with live trading ?",1
"Yes, I think so. A CMA is their money management checking account equivalent, the stuff they're doing to promote themselves as a ""one-stop shop"". 

Your debit card isn't going to get here on time. There's a 3-5 week delay that they're not telling people about:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1g5xxj0/debit\_cards\_not\_being\_sent\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1g5xxj0/debit_cards_not_being_sent_out/)

They give some reasons about *why* it's not going to be on time (they're busy addressing the fraud thing, they're changing the bank they use in the backend, other people signed up too much so there's a backlog), but at the end of the day what matters is:

**you're not gonna get your debit card anytime soon and they're giving people the runaround about it**

  
And for some accounts, all deposits into the money account have a **16 business-day delay before the money can be withdrawn or used for BillPay**, which they also haven't been clearly telling people about, while some accounts only have the 16 day delay for ACH pull transactions, but ACH push ones should have been faster. 

Which is frustrating and makes it hard to use for BillPay because 16 business days is 21 calendar days. So some people have been having trouble getting their bills paid on time, because that $5k deposit made on the 25th or whatever can't pay bills due on the 1st.",-1
"It seems you are misleading here or mixing things or  got a bad explanation from their support. I read this in their help center and also experienced this myself in my account - 
eToro has 2FA with OTP (one-time password) via 3 channels: SMS, Phone and Push.

Push will work only after you will login with 2FA via SMS/Phone (not only credentials) on the Mobile App. Once it’s done, future 2FAs will be sent via Push, and the which is more secured then SMS (you are not exposed to SIM swap attacks etc.). From that point, your mobile app will get push (make sure you enabled Push notifications on your device). Try this and see it should work (try to login form desktop and you will get push to the mobile with OTP).

It’s indeed true that eToro is not offering an Authenticator app as a 2FA method / channel. I’ve also contacted their support on that and they advised it will be added at some point… let’s wait and see… 
But bottom line, they do support 2FA via SMS /Push OTP. I recommend to use Bio Login in case you don’t . It can be activated from settings.",1

I haven't found another application besides IBKR that has delta dollars. For options traders DD is an essential tool. Also, IBKR has the best rates for idle cash. 

Use what works for you. 

All platforms require you to understand how they work for the type of trading you do. I tell all new traders - learn your platform. Been trading about 25 years now. Even E-trade pro or old schwab platforms are functional if you take the time to learn it.",1
"No, you're simply making excuses for a company that doesn't need you to defend it. 

If Wealthsimple designed their software such that CRA having an issue is enough to prevent me from logging in to buy/sell stocks or view my portfolio, that is a Wealthsimple issue. Speaking as a Software developer myself, that would be considered an example of shitty architecture. There is no room for argument there.

And it is perfectly valid to criticize a company for things it can do better on.

They should have known that waiting until the deadline would result in more traffic hitting them on the deadline. They didn't prepare for that, and they need to own that and ensure it doesn't happen in the future. And you need to realize that handwaving away legitimate critique is nothing more than blanant fanboyism and it helps nobody.",-1
"Yeah. I was about to write a new message. I'd say the time was weird. Are you on European time, was it maybe market open? At X5 leverage though, you'd only need quite a small swing, and at market open it might hit the stop loss in that time due to volatility.

Etoro have quite poor spreads, I've had pretty poor experiences shorting with them as well.",-1
"Excuse my ignorance, but is TOS for both the laptop and Phone still available as well as the Schwab? I've not been trading for a while due to work and these posts are of course concerning, thank you.",0

"Do you have online banking with your outside bank you hold your deposits with?? Good I'll help you :) 
Get on the official Online profile and look for transfers>bank to bank transfers. If this option is available then it will let you link your bank account TO fidelity directly for ACH/Direct deposit transfers. You're all set. 
If you have issues setting it up, call them because some banks might have issues during the authentication process. Mine did, but they happily worked around it for me. 
Once you have ACH deposits linked from your bank account you can transfer up to your banks limit..
If you exceed said limit, then you may wire transfer funds to fidelity. But the most cost effective, FAST AND SAFEST WAY NOW IS ACH TRANSACTIONS!!!! 
I hope this helps you out 😎",1
"VOO and FXAIX are essentially the same (both are S&P 500 index funds), but FXAIX has slightly lower expenses so I would go with FXAIX, all the more so because you'll be holding a Fidelity fund in your Fidelity account.  This S&P 500 index fund is an excellent choice for a ""hands off"" long term investment, and especially good to steadily add more to each month.   You're basically buying the 500 largest companies listed on American stock exchanges, together with their ongoing earnings. 

That said, the market is at an all-time high right now, and even up sharply again today after yesterday's election.   I'd maybe wait a few days or maybe put in $2,000, and then $2,000 more next week and keep incrementally moving more into FXAIX to avoid putting it all in at what might be an upward spike. Your uninvested funds are in a money market yielding around 4.5%, so that money is still working for you (albeit not working very hard).",1

"If your main use for ThinkOrSwim is technical analysis, there's no need to endure the difficulties of obtaining a US account. In the past, I explored options for obtaining a live account, but TDA has begun to block these. I recently discovered a company on Reddit that provides a live account tailored for technical analysis. You can switch brokers but still use ThinkOrSwim for technical analysis. I'm hesitant to post the link directly here to avoid it getting banned. Nonetheless, you can find a link to the company in this Reddit thread:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkorswim/comments/vstyep/thinkorswim\_for\_technical\_analysys/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkorswim/comments/vstyep/thinkorswim_for_technical_analysys/)",1

"Sry to hear about your pup. 

This doesn’t pass the smell test, you normally wouldn’t lose 90% of your portfolio value in one day unless you were investing in something super risky like AMC or some other meme stock. Even Bitcoin isn’t that volatile. I would call Fidelity to find out what happened in case it was a mistake.

If it is in an IRA or other pretax account you could be looking at 40% “fee” due to Fidelity fees and IRS taxes and penalties.",1
"I also had a hard time closing some of my positions on Friday via TOS Mobile. Nothing to the degree like you did, I was just selling a few shares I didn’t want to hold anymore, but it took about 5 minutes for the order to post. They were just stuck loading in my working orders tab for a while without actually being sent. I could open orders just fine though, they were posted and filled like normal.",-1
"**Past performance isn't indicative of future performance**, however, a quick google search has J&J with only a 1.05% increase over the last five years... to me that's pretty poor growth over a 5-year period 🤷‍♀️ I'd probably be looking into reasons why that may be so that I had the full picture before committing (i.e., is there a competing company that's stealing potential profits from them? Any on going legal battles that have had impacts (talc powder allegations/financial settlements etc.) do you prefer potential steady growth over potential explosive growth?)

When investing in individual stocks, it's also important to be mindful of world politics / current climates of the world - your plan is to invest for 5-years, well, these are US companies and Trump is presumably going to be in power for at least 4 of those years, and given how gung-ho he seems to be on tariffs (or just the complete lack of predictability from him) you need to consider whether his impact may impact you and any potential stocks you may invest in...

Personally, since you say you're new I'd just whack your 5-year plan in an all-world ETF - it's largely US companies anyway so you'd be marginally investing in the stocks you've got there already, whilst being backed up by the rest of the world so to speak. So if Trump does what Trump does best and causes problems in the US, your loss may potentially be offset a little/you wouldn't be hit *as hard* because via the all-world ETF you've been investing in other countries at the same time...

Honestly, investing in individual stocks is the biggest risk imo, especially if you don't know what you're doing. If you *genuinely* want to invest in individual stocks you really need to do your due diligence. That means taking an interest in quarterly reports/financials, reading up on company prospects, keeping up to date with what's being published about them etc. and really being aware of global politics and having a clear understanding of how **everything** can impact the companies you've got money in.

And even after doing that / continuously keeping yourself in the loop, remember, **you still know nothing**.

Cut the stress and hassle - all-world ETF 😊

Edit: Also, technically, that's really not a diversified portfolio - you have 3 tech and 1 healthcare... all US based.",1
"Whatever caused it, before finding out what happened just know that u now ""shorted"" this asset. Meaning that u have to buy the same amount to close the position.

"A Roth IRA is much more than a simple savings account. It sounds like you opened the account and made a deposit. Now you need to choose how to invest your money. 

What you choose depends on your risk tolerance, time horizon and how active you want to manage the investments.

"I do. Originally when I started out investing more than 10 years ago, when there was less localised investing advice, and cheap online brokerages (and VWRA) weren’t a thing yet, I invested in unit trusts at roughly 25% US, 25% Europe, 25% Asia, 25% SG. 

Over time, the US portfolio grew the most, Europe not too far behind, Asia and SG lagged by a lot. Of course I didn’t keep sticking to the same allocation over the years. The SG unit trust (it is designed to give stable monthly dividends but I have it set up to reinvest automatically) is now under 10% of my portfolio. But I like how it has been relatively stable over the years e.g. in 2022 S&P500 went down 18%, the SG side went up a smidge, and seeing the constant dividends I will likely increase my allocation to it when I retire. 

I have recently started dabbling in SG stocks directly. Have to say that individual stocks are rather volatile and I can’t resist trading them. With the lot size of 100, fees, and volatility, I think accumulating lots of individual SG stocks is not for me. The unit trust with monthly dividends will be way less stressful to manage.",-1

"I'd be careful about any narrow ETFs like that AI one you have. Usually, the most promising players are either not listed on any exchange, AI is only a fraction of what they do, and/or they are already a major part of an broad index. Look closely at the holdings, e.g. the L&G one the main holdings are alibaba, cloudflare, tempus AI, analog devices, raspberry pi, cyberark, palo alto, crowdstrike, asml, and jfrog. Ok some of those are AI firms or are involved in AI but most are not. Cyberark, palo alto, crowdstrike, cloudflare are basically network/security companies. Raspbery pi makes kit. I'm not familiar with jfrog but they look like devsecops firm. Looking at the full list, there's MS, Amazon, Nvidia, Google, etc. You're really just doubling up on the S&P500 but paying higher TER.

In fact, ToS was ready to use on Sunday morning. I ha d a second interaction about checks for one of my accounts that should have arrived two weeks ago. That's obviously not his fault, and he looked into it, gave me an update, and assured me the check would arrive this week, and if not, call back and they'll deal with it.

"Well, it's been a month and there are lots of issues. For example, I have a cash account but Schwab lets me spend way beyond the balance then tells me the next day that they'll restrict me to only settled cash if I do it again. TDA never let me go beyond my balance on the cash account. As a scalper, I don't have time to calculate what's left second by second. I go until the broker tells me I'm done. Never a problem in 15 years with TDA. Schwab immediately a problem.

My opening balance is always the opening balance from the previous day thus all transactions show a running balance that's false. No one seems to be able to fix it. They wanted to remote in to see for themselves (like they can't see it on their end). I let them and wow, it is wrong! So, they'll send some note to someone somewhere and . . . forget it.

I had a .62 buystop set on an OTO and it filled @ .96! Seriously??? .34 slippage! Never, ever in 15 years @ TDA did I get more than a few cents. The OTO converted to an OCO with a stop .10 down and profits @ .10 and .20 up. The price went to 1.34 with no fills. Then it turned and crashed to under .50. My stops supposedly triggered at .64 and .65. Customer services sucks. They told me at their end they can tell me ""millisecond by millisecond"" how the trade went and that it didn't reach the exchange until it was already at .75. Lies. It was placed 47 seconds before the move even began. And even if it was already .75, where was the sellstop .10 and .20 later? All that should have triggered for profit, not loss. They refused to credit anything.

THIS WAS A DOWNGRADE for sure. TIME TO ABANDON CS.",1
"Yup. They do the calculation as ALL WS assets + transfer balance = Qualified amount. If you take out 5% of trasnfer balance, against your qaulified amount, it starts being affected. Its a gatcha thing after I read the TOS and was trying to understand if moving it around would affect it (it didnt), but it effectively holds your non associated to the promo funds hostage.

  
So original balance is 100k. You transfer in 100k. Qualified balance is 200k. 5% of 100k is 5k. You take out 200-10 = 190k. You now get \~90% of the match (i dont actually know, but its likely close. I stopped looking into it as it made my head hurt)",-1

"Can you please explain why bank wires take 1-3 business days?  The entire point (and extra fee) for a wire is processing time no more than a handful of hours. No US bank processes wires that slowly; 1-3 business days is the standard ACH processing time for US banks, which is why I am confused.

Can you explain where the discrepancy comes from? I've come across other retail trading apps that use customer cash to meet the requirements under SEA Rule 15c3-3 to take on more debt. Is this what Moomoo does as well? Meaning the 1-3 business days for a wire indicates that how long it takes Moomoo to unwind customer funds from the omnibus account they are used in?

The timelines don't change when you explicitly revoke consent for Moomoo to take any custodianship by opting out of the cash sweep program either. Can you offer any transparency?",-1

"I think... 2024 wasnt an exceptional year because through my lens it is just a normal year. This year... Is also a normal year.

If I am right you are trying to get a sense whether it is normal for your gains to be wiped out. Yes it is norma if you adopt a buy and hold, strategic portfolio strategy.

Markers don't go up in a straight line.

Dimensional fund advisers have a returns matrix book. We sometimes use it to show clients the uniqueness of returns. You are able to see positive annualised returns then negative annualised returns then go back positive.

I won't be able to describe as well as the book.

You can see the book here: https://www.newcapitalmgmt.com/s/matrix-book-2024-us.pdf

Each pyramid shows the annualised returns of various market indexes over time.

One aspect about coping is also to think about what is it that you think you  understood about your strategy but now have doubts. And I think many didn't really understand how different the returns can be.

The returns in the book go to periods where regimes have changed like the 1970s or before the 1950s where it has been challenging.

It should show you volatility and uncertainty, returns being wiped out is feature you give to get the returns.

If so, if you review the philosophy, were there any thing that took you by surprise? Take this moment to reflect and find out the answer.

My portfolio also got it's two year old gains wipe out to the tune of $184,000.

"Took me awhile to figure out what you are doing. 

You will sell the condo and move back into the HDB, so there will be no more rental income. And you have correctly excluded the HDB property value that you will be living in from your total, for the purposes of FIRE.

It would have been clearer to express the sales proceeds of your condo minus outstanding loan, which becomes investible cash? Basically you will have existing $350K investments plus $450K investible cash, and your wife will have $450 investible cash. I'm neglecting fees associated with the sale, HDB reno and moving etc, but you should probably budget that in.

So together, you have 1.25M investible money. There might be some complication of having to pay back your CPF OA and accrued interest, but we can assume that you will be able to invest the CPF OA in Amundi Index MSCI World or whatever so it can grow in there. 

Whatever is in your SA, you can consider as extra backup. I personally would not consider MA as part of my FIRE number as medical expenses will increase in age (which isn't accounted for in your current expenses) and you will slowly deplete your MA. 

You can also count SA as part of the 50% bonds component of the 50-50 portfolio that SWR framework is based on. 

If you have already set aside your kid's uni fees (excluded from this table), then I think you are ok to FIRE, keeping a careful eye on expenses. 

Do have a closer look at 1) what needs to go back into CPF after selling the condo, and 2) costs associated with selling and moving. Your money outside of OA and SRS needs to be substantial enough that you can safely draw down on it from now until age 55.",1

As you all probably know, but just in case you don't, the market makers shave points to pay for lack of commissions now. How they do it is algorithmic so it can probably vary a cent or two.",-1
I called TDA customer service today and they assured me that Think or Swim will be migrating to Schwab at some point.  Supposedly it is one of the major reasons Schwab purchased TDA.,0

"Too many people are mucking about with random investments without any sense of conviction in them. I actually had a short sell position on Nvidia for over 18 months, leveraged ETF too. It took that long, but it was a small position and I finally made a small profit the other day.

What comes up must come down, but whatever has some kind of intrinsic value is bound to come up. Focus on index funds ideally, but being heavily diversified in individual stocks is fine if they’re mostly large caps. At some point, prices are too low and the fear goes away, and all of a sudden asset prices are so low that everybody wants to buy them.

Rinse and repeat. If these tariff’s go through and the markets are down for four years straight, the Democrats will make free trade a massive part of their campaign, they’ll win if Trump pisses everyone off, and the market will soar so hard that pretty much any stock today will be worth more in the future.",0
"I am not a tax expert, but it's treated as capital gains income. The tax rate depends on your total income for the year you sell - 2025 - in this case. You can go to Wealthsimple tax calculator online for 2024, choose Alberta,  and plug in your numbers.  It gives an estimate of total taxes and your average and marginal tax rate. You don't log in to use this estimator.

If 1500 in capital gains is your total income for the year, you will pay $0 tax. Lets say you make 30k working,  then you would owe $4297. When I add $1500 capital gains, your tax bill goes up to $4484, a difference of $187. So your tax bill on the gains won't be too high. It really depends on all of your income. 

You should be filing taxes because you will benefit from government credits like gst and climate rebate (until this is canceled).

You can also look at taxtips.ca where there is a detailed tax calculator to estimate your annual tax bill. There is a chart showing the tax rates by province and source (dividends, gains, regular income). I hope this helps",0

"Oh wow, do you withdraw regularly?

I have a set amount direct deposited into Fidelity and then invest it into an ETF from there. So far I have never sold and withdrawn any money so I guess I wouldn’t have known what to expect. So sounds like if I needed that money this week. I might have to wait a whole month to get it. That’s crazy. 

Is this a new policy of on affects some people?",0
"Hi u/appnanoooo5,

Thanks for the question and thanks to u/Mocserismi for the helpful example.

First of all, you need a margin account to have a margin loan.  If you have a margin account, you don't have to borrow funds, but it gives you that ability.  You cannot borrow funds in a cash account.  Both account types are available at Moomoo.

Margin trading is buying securities with borrowed funds, using the assets in your account as collateral.  In much the same way that a bank can lend you money if you have equity in your house, your brokerage firm can lend you money against the value of your investments. Stocks have both initial margin requirements and maintenance margin requirements.

The margin rate is the interest rate on the margin loan.  So, it is a very important factor if you decide to borrow funds. Moomoo has one of the lowest rates in the industry.

Because margin creates leverage, it is increasing the potential for gains, but it is also increasing the potential for losses, so please consider and fully understand the risks before buying stocks on margin.

For more information, check out our help center topic on margin trading [moomoo US Help Center-What are margin trading and short selling](https://www.moomoo.com/us/support/topic4_240?from_platform=4&platform_langArea=us&global_content=%7B%22promote_id%22%3A%2213764%22%2C%22sub_promote_id%22%3A%2221%22%7D).

Happy Trading!🐮

"The lengthy deposit times in Canada is awful; as a small/newer investor just putting in small amounts (ive tried as low as $100) it takes 4 business days to become available or 1-2 days with large bank fees attached.  I recently switched over from Wealthsimple, debating switching back or looking elsewhere just to have the instant deposits available again, 4 days is kind of a joke and might be a deal breaker",-1
"Great to know, thanks! Did you have to initiate another transfer to move the cash over after Schwab liquidated the fractional shares? Or was it automatic?",0
">The thing with it not being covered by FSCS, like all investments isnt something to worry about because all it means is if trading212 were to go bankrupt then you would lose all of your money because they are the ones investing it for you. You dont actually invest directly.

This has confused me... are you saying if I had £10K worth invested within T212 (albeit in various ETFs) if T212 were to go bankrupt that £10K is gone? I was under the understanding that I *own* the share, ergo the asset is mine? Surely my 'stake' in those assets are bought up/absorbed by bigger brokers/banks (i.e. Vanguard or the highest bidder so to speak)??? My asset/stake in the ETF doesn't disappear, just the platform I use to buy/sell said asset doesn’t exist anymore?",0
"UPDATE:  
After 20 minutes in an online chat with the trade desk at Schwab, and after them trying to send me to the same places as the suggestions here, it was determined that this feature is locked within the program.  That is odd to me because nearly everything else is adjustable to some degree within TOS.  
The support guy, David, suggested a login to the web version of TOS and provide feedback through a link at the top of the homepage, but that doesn't create a support ""ticket"" or ""order"" of any kind, only provides a suggestion to the development team that someone is interested in being able to set the default ""WIDTH"" of a Trailstop order ticket so they don't have to change it manually each time it pops up.  
Perhaps, I'll fool around with a Template and see how it works, but running through the process in my mind tells me that it's going to be nearly as cumbersome as changing it in the ticket itself.",-1
"From what I am hearing, WeBull and TastyTrade and IBRK are all Java based and I have no issues running them with the same number of windows and charts and indicators all at the same time. I love ToS!!! She’s my girl until she gives me no choice, but to leave her.",1
"It’s awful.  I moved to Fidelity, which also isn’t the greatest but much better than Schwab.",0
"You can get more than 1% with chexy - if you use a cashback credit card that earns more than 1.75% (higher than chexy fees) like the scotia momentum VI - you can get up to 2.25% net cashback on all bills, rent, etc. I'll be using them rather than wealthsimple until they come up with a better deal 🤷‍♀️",0
"You’re restricted to closing only until you get your equity back to 25k. You can call Schwab and ask them to remove the flag but if you start day trading again, you probably won’t get it taken off a second time. It’s a FINRA requirement that brokers have to have a reasonable belief you’re not going to engage in day trading before they can remove the flag.",0
"This is known as spoofing. Glad you caught on to their tactics. They can spoof any number in existence to make it look like it’s coming from a legitimate company on the caller ID. Not much Schwab can do other than educate its customers on the red flags to look out for if something like this happens.

Freaking despise scammers.",0
"I have both. I love thinkorswim. I find using schwab for trading clunky and slow, but it's possible I'm not configured correctly. Td app/website is between those 2 extremes.",-1
"I've been with schwab for 30 years, no complaints.  Checks deposited online clear promptly. Great trade execution.",0
"DO NOT GO TO ALLY!  I spent years frustrated with their poor customer service and lack of user friendliness before switching several accounts over to Fidelity. 

As others have said, Fidelity does not have HYSA. But I’ve found SPAXX to be just as good. And they have other useful products: brokerage, checking, 401K, Charitable DAF, etc. While not perfect, I’ve found them better than average for many banking needs.",1
"Exactly you got it!
So a direct ACH from your bank works as a workaround because compared to what we usually use (direct transfer EFTs initiated by fidelity) use a different verification process than ACH transfers. An ACH transfer from your bank to fidelity will usually debit the amount you request immediately for transfer to clear the funds before sending (putting the liability only on the outside institution) and the bank pushes your deposits for you to fidelity, some within 1-3 business days depending on traffic but since I began using ACHs my money has been received sometimes by the end of the same business day and cleared for investing and withdrawals immediately as it's already cleared funds from my bank. 😁

I'm almost certain you can use this method yourself in your situation but if you don't have a secondary fidelity account to make the deposits and initiate contributions I recommend opening one or speaking to a fidelity rep and ask if contributions can be made directly in that way for now. 

Hope this workaround can benefit you in some way!!",0
"I moved to Fidelity. When I first selected a brokerage after a bit of research my first pick was TD, followed by Fidelity, then Schwab. I already had some accounts at Fidelity and figured it made sense to move the account than be forced into my third pick. I’m sure Schwab will be fine; I just wanted to consolidate and simplify things. 

I went through a similar account change when USAA sold its brokerage to Victory Capital. I left things there for a year or so before I decided to move the account. I probably would have taken that account to TD, but they didn’t have a few of the funds I was in, so that one ended up at Fidelity. Pretty sure I can still long into my closed Victory account after more than a year and access my old statements and transaction history. I was really surprised TD would lock up account access before the money was even transferred given how much they push electronic statements and documents.",1
"A few hours later, I got an automated email from Fidelity saying my billpay was canceled, so I called back to inquire and they said there was now a fraud restriction on the account probably due to the cancelled transfers (that Fid themselves recommended due to the circumstances and themselves cancelled).  I called back the next morning and spoke to a fraud services rep for an hour, who went thoroughly through my account, asked lots of questions, and told me not to worry, that they saw their system put an automatic flag on my account due to the transfers they canceled. They asked why I'd had so many ACH transfers lately and I explained that I'd had to scramble to move money because of their new 21+ day funds settling policy (and because I was just about to go out of town), otherwise my bills that come out of that account would have bounced. After an hour, the rep assured me that everything was ""good to go"" and that my account was ""all good"" and he removed the fraud flag. When I try to use my ATM card a few days later, it declines, and when I called in after the hurricane desperately needing to access my cash, Fid told me all of my accounts have been closed and they are not able to give any reason. To this day, they have yet to inform me of the account closures in any way - letter, email, or phone - other than me just calling in myself and them telling me they decided to close the accounts and that they do not have to tell me the reason. So I have been stuck in a catastrophic disaster without power for 14 days trying to deal with Fid who locked up my funds and closed my accounts without informing me. Unfortunately, my experience with Fidelity has turned from 98% positive into 100% negative. Be warned!",-1
"What do you mean by ""US self-directed LIRA"". LIRA are Canadians, so you must mean LIRA holding USD securities? I think you need to read this:

There's no difference between a LIRA, a TSFA or an RRSP when it comes to US titles. I have two LIRA with WS and I can hold both CAD and USD currencies/securities. I can't remember if I had US titles when I transferred in-kind, but I from what I read it would have been fine.

"I beg to differ and filed a lawsuit. You just havent experienced it yet, or did not know. But there is a reason they do not add spread data on your account statement with data on your trades. 

Etoro is a market maker which regularly uses designed features to enrich itself. This is harder in non CFD trading. In CFD trading, they are worse than any 3rd rate hustler. I speak from experience.",0
"Personally I’d avoid eToro, I had an account but closed it and got out. Their platform is “ok”, does the job but their customer service is an absolute joke. They don’t respond to tickets, they fob you off, their social media replies are just for show, you raise a complaint and they just close it without responding. I left not because of the platform, fees or anything like that. I left because I wouldn’t trust my money with a company that doesn’t respond to customers, and when they do, they just fob you off.",-1
"I’ve been telling people that for years; maintain a good relationship with a bank.  That those relationships are invaluable.  I’ve faulted Fidelity with overselling services and promises.  But everything in one place appealed to the less financially sophisticated.  And now this.  Fidelity is largely silent because they have exposure here.  But at the same time, the barrage of crime everywhere posts is reminiscent of another largely financially less sophisticated meme stock bunch whining about removing the Buy Button and waiting for MOASS.  🤷‍♂️",-1
"If you want to input code into an order ticket and have the order execute based on that code, for example an MA crossover… yes Thinkorswim can do that. All of my trades are triggered with code.
Thinkorswim has its limitations compared to other software for automated trading, but you can trigger an order or group of orders based off almost any study condition you can imagine. There’s some things other software can do by default that requires a bit of working around.

But if you’re looking to simply have buy and sell orders triggered by code/studies etc.

Thinkorswim can easily and absolutely, 100% do that.",1

And no one can do anything about.  I solved that problem by moving my financial hub to a Fidelity CMA, but when the system can shut you down and there is no way to tell it that it made a mistake, it is a mess.",-1

"There's an insane amount of check kiting going on due to Tik Tok and for a while Fidelity was being hit by a ton of fraud and so in response they have dialed back their consumer friendliness to about the minimum required by law.

"You need to be fully aware of the math that’s underlying these studies. Based on another comment it looks like at least one of these studies is using a smoothing method.

Another thing is different brokers have different market data. They are not all the same. It’s because different brokers have deals with different exchanges for their data. Not all data is created equal and there’s frequently differences between broker market data, which then will affect your study.

Third, the studies are each using different box sizes, and that will obviously affect how the plot comes across on the screen. If you’re gonna compare studies across software, make sure you size the plot area exactly the same on each, so you have a better picture of the difference",0

"ya, wtf.  its not accepting my TD login.  so the login prompt says ""if you already have a schwab account, maybe you need to try that"".  so i did.


 so i went over and tried my schwab login.   that worked.  however, now the program ONLY pulled up my schwab accounts.  however, they all say ""this account is not authorized to trade in thinkorswim"".

so i click and try to follow the guide to 'enable trading in think or swim"", and that doesn't work.

edit: nope.  this did not help me.  i was able to find the gear and exact thing you mentioned, but it did not work for me.  it would seem my TD account is completely un-accessible through think or swim.  thankfully i don't need to make any big changes in my account and will be working from home tomorrow.

edit2:  ok, very odd.  i tried the steps that OP menteioned again.  i wanted to get the error, and the phone number to call.  but.....this time they worked.  i was able to log into my TD account on think or swim, can see all the positons just like before, etc.  

i will admit, the only other things i had done last night.
- logged into schwab account (wasn't able to do anything), logged out
- logged into ""paper money schwab account"" (didn't do anything, so i logged out)
- logged back into live, schwab account, didn't do anything, logged out

i remember when i first did my TD account years ago, there was some odd thing about having to log into paper money account first or something, so i thought i'd try that with the schwab one first too.",-1
"Thanks for the explanation. I also trade options frequently, but it sounds like you've gotten used to the TDA site and weren't using TOS much. I use TOS exclusively, so as long as TOS is available at Schwab, and not crippled, it sounds like those of us who use TOS will be fine.",0

Same situation as you and when I called they gave me the increase in fraud story as well - but no other financial institution is doing this.

It's a growth fund so there isn't an appreciable dividend.  Looks like the last time it paid one was 2016.  When it does pay one it is only paid once per year in December and it's pretty pithy.

Great fund, though!  I keep a substantial portion of my 401k in it.  But it's a growth play not for income.",0

"Did you increase the MEM allocation?  You have a lot of RAM?  What's your CPU clock speed? Intel or AMD architecture? How many screens and charts? What's the # of symbols you're streaming?

Mine was perfect before Schwab, and I haven't completely figured out if the new one is as good/better/or worse yet.",0
"I love ThinnkirSwim so I plan on staying with TDA/Schwab, at least minimally.  Why?  Because I have major issue with IRA core cash sweeps and TDA/Schwab not allowing us to use MMFs as collateral for options trading.  Other brokerages allow you to keep core positions of cash in govt-based money market funds and still use as collateral for options trading.  As an example, Fidelity automatically sweeps to SPAXX for IRA accounts, allowing clients to collect -4.6% interest on uninvested collateral.  With Schwab, anyone who trades options in an IRA only collects 0.35% interest in the standard sweep account.  Schwab makes a lot of money from core sweeps and isn’t sharing it with its clients.

This policy is likely to stay in place for the duration of inverted interest rates, so I may move the majority of my money (7 figures) to Fidelity and keep a minimal amount with TDA just to be able to use ToS for technical analyses.",1
"The new wealth of what we called ‘cash rich’ Singaporeans are built from the continuous recycling of singapore properties. This episode started with the entry of mainland Chinese, some becoming new citizens, who prop up prices of condos, landed properties and coffee shops significantly. Unfortunately, the government did not rein them in and their psf prices have shaped future psf of homes and coffee shops in singapore in the past 5 years. Landed properties have more than doubled, coffee shops have seen record breaking tender and purchase prices in just within 5 years. Many of the mainland Chinese and other foreigners have since left with the ABSD increase.

But Singaporeans are left here and still hoping prices will continue to increase from there. 

With the upcoming economic difficulties, more people will lose jobs, banks will become more strict in giving out loans, and government will become more cautious on market movement probably will introduce more cooling measures to prevent speculative flipping in the current challenging market.

Expect private property prices to dip at least 15-20% from its peak now within 9-12 months once the Trump tariffs start to be felt globally. This will at least bring property affordability to a more realistic level. As to whether it will dip further depends on how severe the global depression goes and for how long. 

Singapore gains from international trade - import and reexport. It also depends heavily on its neighbours and China for food and other essential imports. If these countries are affected, do you think Singapore will be immune from all these ??

Just be prepared for the worst. Best thing to do now is to have sufficient cash for emergencies. Those who over leveraged on properties will unfortunately have to experience the greatest shocks later.",0
Going through the same thing. Called this morning to see if they would do anything for me. They said I could ask for an emergency check or something but nothing else. Opened accounts at the end of October. Initiated a transfer on 11/4 and it’s expected to clear on 11/27. Since there was no indication this would occur and they refuse to do anything about it I’m immediately transferring the money out and closing my accounts when it clears. This just screams incompetence to me. My sentiment after this is to stay away from these big established brokerages.,-1
"You're good!  You don't get an RL-32 for FHSA contributions, only for taxes that might have been paid in the cases where there was a taxable withdrawal of some kind",0
Yea that thing is in an absolute horrible location. Middle of a trade click that by accident and it can be a disaster getting back to live.,-1
"It’s hard to know with the information you’ve provided.

How are you making the transfer and from where? Do you have a USD account with a polish bank and are making a SWIFT wire transfer? This is a very expensive way of doing it as your transfer will be send around a bunch of different banks before it reaches IB and each take their own fees. $50 seems like a lot to me but not out of the question. It us usually a fixed amount not a percentage so this method is not great unless you’re transferring thousands of dollars at a time. I get charged about USD 15 for my bank doing it this way. I’m in New Zealand which may be cheaper than Poland.

It is usually cheaper to send the money in your local currency using the local payment system if IB can accept it and then doing a currency trade on IB to get USD.",0
"""Plus, the whole damn thing needs to be usable and not require 20 clicks to find watchlists, option tables (all of them - not just a few dates), my current investments and my net worth, and Hey Schwab! How about some colors - green for up, red for down, we would all really appreciate that! Needless to say, these things and many more features were available on the TDA home page.""

Are you talking about the phone app or desktop?",0
What a terrible lesson to learn from all this,-1
"I'm consistently amazed at the number of people in this sub who think that companies will execute trades on your behalf for no fucking money. Trades cost money, admin costs money, holding accounts cost money. They make their money from subscriptions, if you want to actively trade that costs them money to facilitate and there's no company that will do it for free.  Look at RobinHood - you're not the customer, you're the product.",0
"Where they advertised it as zero fee. They really mean zero upfront fee. But they will take overnight fees every night. Lots of crookey, slimey stuff like that. 

Like the OP said, lots of hidden/disguised stuff in t/c, restricting different trades in different market types, then when you query it, they'll say 'oh we have it written in our legislation we reserve the right to have a 200 pip spread in volatile coniditions' then you look at other brokers rates at the time and their spreads are all normal.

Again, this is all stuff that if you are a noob/first time investor, which is their target audience, you are not going to notice, which is why it's predatory.",0
"Agree, with the CS app I am always getting streaming quotes errors.  Ameritrade app was so easy to navigate, simple is just what is needed.  Starting to use the thinkorswim app more and more.",-1
"Yuhh it’s normal. Just as you can’t close an account with cash in it, you have to transfer it out to somewhere or withdraw it. I experienced this this week with Plum. Freetrade should be happy I’m leaving Plum for them yet the still don’t have some hot ETFs yet.",1
"Telus is the worst by far imo. telecoms doesn't seems really good business right now in canada with increasing competition, lowering of prices to retain and acquire consumers the actual removal of many barriers to entry. I wonder if this entire industry will have utilities like return in the future.

That being said, it's cheap right now, divy yield is high. It seems to have outperformed market expectations lately, I am eager to see what the future holds. 

I am excited to eat my socks 2-3 years from now if it rebounds.

An other point that could impact leding income is Brookfield. Brookfield is not a bad holding, but that FT investigation that I have yet to read could have wild impacts on the business if claims are true, and that bad.

That being said, I have no position myself on single stocks, I only hold indexes.",0
"I've been moving funds into and out of Fidelity without issues during this whole period where others are having issues. I expect it has something to due with fraud algorithm and where funds are coming from. While I'm sure fraud hit them potentially hard, they have 300 billion under custody. Anything big enough to impact their liquidity wouldn't be check fraud cases but a massive, massive attack that would likely bring a financial crash with it as huge institutional investors would be impacted.

I think the issue is more if funds are coming from cash apps/fintechs into new accounts and those accounts have a history of high risk investment and lots of transfer activity, those accounts are likely near universally flagged.",0
"Im far too under qualified to give suggestions. My freetrade account is just my fun money i can afford to lose.

I just use vanguard for my main investment isa with a target retirement plan. They do all the work and adjust my portfolio as i get older.

Just not as fun as investing individual stocks hence the freetrade account!",0
"All my transfers to Fidelity CMA have been initiated from the Fidelity website. Once the money goes in my CMA, it still takes like 2 weeks for it to clear.
Note - I opened my account about 4 months ago.",0
"Can't we just keep using the mobile TOS? Personally I don't like mobile trading apps, but I heard that TOS is a good one and is not being discontinued.",0
"It’s Vanguard’s ETF that invests in the S&P500 (the top 500 largest companies listed on the American stock market), and it reinvests the dividends back into the fund. 

It’s the British counterpart to VOO, which is considered by many to be one of, if not, the best ETF on the market, as it has a great track record in return, averaging 11.4% over the past decade.",0
"you gotta use the real exchange for crypto only like binance gate.io okx btbit coinbase kraken. top 10-15 on coinmarketcap.

that way you bought the real cryto abd transfer in and out easily on blokchain. also choose the one that you can withdraw to your bank as well",0
"I don’t think there is a limit. I am using 4 different currencies so far. Best to always do FX from USD to whatever currency you need as they are the most liquid crosses. And you can transfer in using any currency accepted which I think the list is very long , and there are different transfer instructions for each currency so make sure you set up a different transfer method by currency you use. Best FX will be at IBKR in my experience compared to banks.",0
"Just chiming in on the origin of good faith violations. There are mechanisms to ""undo"" trades when they are fraudulent or other types of illegitimate transaction. So if you buy with unsettled funds, sell something and wire the money out - and the funds came from say a stolen debit card and get charged back, the broker would be out the money",0
"Thanks. OK, so if it's ITM, next day I will just see some extra cash in the account as they will close it for me.

Yeah, I mean normally I would definitely take action and close/sell the contract myself before expiration. I was asking as you never know, there could be an emergency situation in your life and you might not be able to log in to your IBKR account or something. So good to know that even they won't be providing you with a service, you won't be totally screwed either.",0
">After providing information for the identity checks, the app now suggests I’m trying to sign up.

yes, that's what happens when you use a different email address. it's all fine until the NI number, which fails because it already exists on your original account.

Could Freetrade have temporarily changed the email on the account?",0
It’s supposed to be available later this year.  I use Tos all the time and my account hasn’t been moved yet.  Seems like they’ll get the software moved over then move all the remaining user accounts.  Presumably then anyone at Schwab could use Tos.,0
"I am fine financially, but I feel for those who have all their finances tied up right now. If all your bill pays were through fidelity and you didn't know this occurred, it could screw up someone really bad.",-1
They already mentioned that in the newsletter that they are going to charge fees like Wealthsimple invest. So it’s like getting shitty service for money or better but they will not be going to give this free.,-1
"You pay for the L2 data from your broker (level 1 is free). Stick with IBKR, their software is fine but a bit outdated. Lightspeed is expensive. Check out Verillo Trading on YouTube , he has a good video on IBKR L2 subscriptions. And check out Ross’ videos on the various brokers and platforms, also his L2 videos.",-1
"So they cannot push an ACH transfer to UMB Bank of Kansas City, MO ?

If you are using the right routing info that is what it should look like to your credit union,

Routing number is 101205681.   The account number is 17 digits, of which the last several numbers are your brokerage account number and the beginning numbers depend upon the exact type of account you have.

I just use the numbers that are printed on the UMB checkbook.",0
"Good to see a young person thinking about retirement accounts.  Compound interest.  Didn't know anything about that when I was young.  As the previous post mentioned, investopedia is a good place to research. I love it and have used it a lot.  There are many youtube videos about investing you might find helpful.  SWAGX is a bond fund.  Maybe adding a stock etf like the S&P 500 or something would be good to balance.  You can google best etfs 2025 and get some ideas.  I also like to look at the Morningstar ratings on the side bar of the investment page on Schwab.",0
"As soon as I saw your op, it immediately reminded me of certain posters (as recently as today) taking our general complaints or even constructive suggestions to Schwab personally and passionately.",0
"Hi again silver-fusion, yes James V holdings does indeed say Vanguard S&P 500 (acc) 👍
Anytime I now add ££ to it I go 212 stocks isa and click the big blue + to the right of my total value (£2558.30) then do instant bank transfers. 
Sounds like what you’ve said is right. Thats brilliant 🤩 thanks for your help silver-fusion.",0
"Has anyone else tried to contact Interactive Brokers lately? Where's the ""INTERACTIVE"" in Interactive Brokers? I never knew in my entire 56 Years of life that a company could be so innane, so Deft, so unmanaged & so impossible to deal with until I met Interactive Brokers. Opened a Trading account, funded it, sent in all the credentials required BUT, months latter, they're still asking for materials they initially acknowledged getting. Now, there's no way to reach them to return my money. Is mine an isolated case or is this how Interactive Brokers do business? Next stop, the SEC, Texas Governors Office & any other authorities that could get involved & lastly my Attorney.",1
For SGX nowadays we can buy less than 100 units via brokers at least I know moomoo can. Poems has this option now but seem not working already feedback wait for them respond. This means blue chip counter like banks can take own time own target buy each trade so much more affordable. Con is the price may not be good as full share market but for me ok.,0
"No, I am not wrong - you must have missed this reply I wrote to someone else:

  
*Well hang on - I just found a link in an old email from TDA about the transition that sent me to*

[*https://welcome.schwab.com/schwab-id?cmp=em-XWS*](https://welcome.schwab.com/schwab-id?cmp=em-XWS)

*So I clicked on the ""Start the authorized user login process"" button and it took me to a page that said* 

***""Our records indicate that you already have a Login ID. Please enter your Login ID and password to login. If you need help call Schwab at 1-800-435-4000""***

*So I called the number and got to a rep in only 15 secs - explained the situation to her but she said nobody at Schwab can access anything until Monday, and she told me  I'll have to call them next week to get my new username and temp PW.*",0
"No, no I did not. You think Warren Buffett was investing during the Great Depression? It is true that bear markets do not stay nearly as long as bull markets, but my point was simply that yesterday wasn't a one off, but the beginning of a severe economic crisis in the United States, which is why Buffett pulled over 300 billion out of the market to keep as cash for what was coming. This was an economic certainty predicted since well before the election. I was simply offering an opinion about the state of the American economy so people can do with it what they will, but you clearly haven't researched the great depression at all, or what caused it, and what happened to a massive amount of publicly traded companies after the crash... what happened to a massive amount of investors during the great depression, or even American people. The market isn't just numbers, it's businesses that can fail. I provided information and have further provided reading that people can do to educate themselves. Do with it what you will.",0
"Its all stocks, how does 212 UI compare with FT? I really like the UI of freetrade and would like something similar if poss",0
"I think you are going to get a bias answer in this community, but I’d personally use Fidelity. In my experience, they have less fees than Schwab and better customer service.",-1
"I am in a similar situation. Basically, when you open account you will need to submit proof of residency. For example, payslip, utilities slips, etc. Based on submitted documents IBKR will determine your tax residency. That has nothing to  do with your citizenship. Depending on which two specific nations are involved and any tax treaties they may have, you may have to file for capital gains in only one nation, both, or neither. You are personally responsible for filing tax documents to appropriate countries and making sure that you abide by the law. If necessary, you may consult with the international tax specialist or wealth manager, IBKR does not assume responsibility. Messing around with all of the above is not advisable.",0
"TD Ameritrade's API is available today for existing users. I have jobs running against it right now. If you have an API key you are good-to-go.

New user sign-ups are not being accepted. Schwab will release a replacement API as part of the TDA-to-Schwab migration. No specific release date has been announced.

"IBKR just shows the (unfilled) order, not the trade?  Is there actually a trade report?  Or updated positions showing the result of the buy?  If it doesn't look like the order executed and you think the limit should have been hit, then double-check the time in force and flags on the order (I don't know what time zone you're in, but if it's in Eastern or central US/Canada/Americas, the DAY order looks like it was received and submitted during regular trading hours for US exchanges, assuming this happened yesterday).  I assume your account is not restricted from trading this asset because I think IBKR checks this before order submission.  I'm also assuming there wasn't a halt on the stock or other problem with any order systems.",0
"Thanks, I can see it is a Champion account over $1M and still listed in the Top 10 for Italy.

I was in the Top 10 for Australia but they removed me from the list when they blocked new copiers - I've talked with another Champion PI from Australia where they did the same thing.

The only Champion PI left in the Australian Top 10 list is in the $300k - $1M range - [https://www.etoro.com/discover/people/results?copyblock=false&page=5&period=LastTwoYears&sort=-copiers&pagesize=10&country=12](https://www.etoro.com/discover/people/results?copyblock=false&page=5&period=LastTwoYears&sort=-copiers&pagesize=10&country=12)

Maybe it's different in different countries, or perhaps they grandfathered in people who already had CISI certification.  I haven't taken the exam yet, do you already have the certificate?",0
"Havent heard of that one. Ive tried lots but always went back to Ameritrade. Can say: Im going to test out ally because I get their market updates and geez they have smart ppl. Also Im real big on these brokers having their own banks. Ally does.

Dont know their extended hours yet to recommend them. Do know Schwab is horrific. In shock Ameritrade did this. Fooled me. Thought jerks cares about clients.",-1

Fidelity is literally marketing the CMA to attract checking customers and telling people to treat it as such. They are trying to be treated like a bank and utterly failing at it so fuck them.,-1
"Overall renovation costs including furnishings can easily be 20-30% of the cost of your flat.

People on /r/singapore and /r/singaporefi tend to lean heavily toward just keeping everything barebones and as cheap as possible so the topic of reno costs often gets glossed over, but if you desire a bit more for your home be prepared to set aside a pretty penny.

In particular, the furnishings are a big wildcard especially if you aren't bringing much over from your parents' house. You could go the IKEA route and furnish the whole place for very cheap, but I personally think it's better to put down a little more money on some of the more core furniture items like your dining table and sofa. Doesn't have to be a splurge, but a good sofa could easily run you 3-6k, something to think about.",0
"Funny enough, UBS didn't know it either. Ameritrade was asking for the ""friendly account name,"" and they were like, what on earth is that? I ended up just putting my complete name down a second time, and fortunately, the transfer went through just fine.",0

"Yes and yes. Fidelity notifies the IRS of that payment, and it would be credited to your tax number be used as withholding on your income tax.

It is pretty rare to have withholding like that, as the others have said. Is this something you want, or not?",0
"If you want your wife to gain ownership of everything in your original account when you die, you should make her the primary beneficiary of the account. On the TDA web site: Client Services > My Profile > Personal Information > Beneficiaries.

If you want to share ownership now, the easiest way is probably to transfer everything from the original brokerage account to the new joint account. You could then close the original account if you like. 

>Would she still have access to the funds of my original account if I was to die 

If you are the sole owner and you die the account will be frozen, I believe. Your beneficiaries would contact TDA with the death certificate to get access to their share. If there were no beneficiaries defined on the account, your executor would be responsible for the dispensation of the account. [Disclaimer: I'm not a legal or tax expert but my family did go through this process some time ago.]",0

"Ya, but in general with B2B $ movement it still don't smell right. Couple days ago I pulled $ into my FIDO taxable, which I invested immediately, and customary for brokers to do. About 1 hour later, FIDO debited my external checking account, which looks like they used RTP transfer. I think FI's can do more than they lead on, especially if they learn to share with other banks, like they taught us as kids on the playground.",0
"I’m just confused, how are you meant to use margin like a cash account? Is this not possible?

In Canada, you can only sell naked puts, meaning you have to “cash secure” them yourself. I don’t understand how I can treat a margin account like a cash account, and never use leverage",0
"Its difficult to estimate anything when they haven't disclosed earnings,  i can't find their Q results anywhere. I have a large portfolio with many risky shares, but risk should counter possible gains and CHL doesnt strike me as worthy. If you interested in Chinese shares check TIGR, their financials check out, also Lumen if I recall correctly,  i have invested in Li Auto, Xpeng and NiO among other Chinese companies,  I was there early but if you long term there is still more potential in them thn in CHL. In my opinion",0
"It happened to me when I redeposited too early after withdrawing (as opposed to over directly contributing) between WS TFSA accounts during COVID.
I tried to reverse out of the situation but because funds had gone through a non TFSA account, they had officially left the TFSA. ( I was unable to do a TFSA -> TFSA transfer and was erroneously told that provided all accounts were at the same institution then the CRA should be ok with it.

Stupid error on my part but the CRA were not flexible in the interest payments at all. TFSAs need to be much more user friendly imo.

Most TFSA holders have one account. It’s not hard to calculate the room and present an estimate to the account holder.

Accounts today now have warnings and reminders about the rules because of this very problem. 
In the past there weren’t as many reminders and many people made mistakes unintentionally and have been penalized for it, sometimes wiping out the gains on the savings of using a TFSA in the first place, which is counter to the point of opening the account.

The CRA have been unsuccessfully sued for this very problem and even when the judge sympathized with the plaintiff, their hands were tied due to the legislation around TFSAs. In other countries with similar account types you can’t easily over contribute because the deposit process takes you through the calculation steps and will prevent you over contributing. It’s still possible to mess up but the chances are slim to none. 

Apologies, I don’t have the citation to the case but it’s not difficult to find.",0
"Yes, TD Ameritrade provides software which in their customer agreement is not 100 percent reliable. In reality, is 99.99% reliable. And in the 0.01 percent of cases, the majority of the cases where they are at fault they do make an adjustment in the customer's favor. This is exactly the same at every other broker. Your concept of ""insurance"" is not in any way applicable in this situation.

As far as ""banks,"" in your example, if you are using a bank's app, and the app failed due to their error, for example, you deposited a check electronically, but it failed to deposit, then they would likely also treat this the same way, in other words, they would look at the situation and make a judgment in favor of the customer or in favor of the bank. No ""insurance"" would every be involved there either. If you are ""scared"" of this, then perhaps investing or trading using electronic software may not be the best option for you, honestly. Why not just go visit a branch in person and be less ""scared?""",1
"A few additional other things to add:

- MMF at Merrill do NOT have a sweep feature, so you need to manually buy/sell MMF shares. A little bit of a pain, but not a dealbreaker. 
- If you have $20K+ at Merrill+BofA you’ll get Preferred Rewards bonuses on BofA credit cards. This can give you a huge boost every month in cash back. 
- If you want to transfer shares from Vanguard, it’s pretty easy and painless. They transfer in kind, so no need to sell or pay taxes. 
- There are some securities Merrill will not let you buy. Most “normal” securities are fine, but some of more exotic or risky ones are restricted. Call them if you want to check before opening an account.",0
Add social trading or copy trading feature to copy successful traders and they collect a fee for it. Like Etorro. I don't have time to manage my account and would pay for some pro to manage it on the brokers side.,0
I only used TOS both desktop and mobile which is still working with Schwab so all good.,0
"I solved mine already. It turns out it was just a misunderstanding or more like somewhat misleading information on the app. When you deposit to your money app that money will only be there, not yet useable to invest BUT the normal etoro app will already see that money being available. But it’s not. You need to transfer it over from the money app to the investment app by the ‘deposit’ button. I thought that deposit button is for outside deposits not already deposited money from the money app. Well, it is for depositing from outside as well as from the money app. It’s basically a double deposit.",0
"Didnt look at youtube cuz I nvr use sound. Sorry. 

Anyway, Im trying get info bout shorting in premarket at Schwab. Info is vague. Learned ages ago nvr to assume will be same.

So, trying stay with TDA while I figure this out. Btw, ur so right. Ive tried many online brokers but always came back to TDA. 

Closest Ive found so far is IBKR. Like it cuz has more overnight stocks available and lets me short any time I want.

Anyway, losing TDA has been traumatic.",1
"Being able to have Tradingview connected and TWS open at the same time, Fix the delayed data in Tradingview screener and a full DOM available.

"Lots of people get mail, email, or offers thru services offering great deals. The large print says it all - NOT.

More often than not. The fine print, somewhere on the same or next page, spells out the exact terms and conditions. OP, you really are not that gullible to not look out for the fine, layweresq wording. Every offer has a hook, and fine print.",0
"Your new broker might reimburse the fees. TDA did that for me a few years ago. With that said, I would just stick with Schwab. I've used a lot of brokers for myself and my clients that I tax returns for. Schwab isn't perfect and their web pages so slow after the recent few updates, but they're still I think the best.

If you want a hack, can you transfer your nine accounts into one then do one transfer?",-1
"Why the hell is IBKR desktop so bad that it can't even load my positions?

Why is the cell phone app so complicated and aids? 

Why the hell am I using IBKR when the GUI is so damn terrible compared to its competitors?",-1
"These are perfectly good picks. My recommendation would be to go more into VUAA and other ETFs when looking at long term goals. Companies like SOFI and PATH are probably unlikely to even exist by then but you’re young anyway so keep those positions and just see how you do. It’s important to have some individual shares as an investor (~15%) since they will keep you interested and invested in the markets, so it’s not a problem at all. Just keeping more of your money flowing into the likes of VUAA",0
"Thanks!!  I also looked at TDA … I think the info on moomoo is just presented oddly. 

ACH withdrawals are free on both moomoo and TDA.  They just take up to 5 days or so.

For faster service you can use wire transfers, but there is a charge for outgoing wire transfers on both, and moomoo is a little cheaper.

TDA charges $25 for outgoing transfers (both domestic and international), while the moomoo fees you quoted above are a little less.

I think the most significant reason to think about moomoo is that it is a Chinese company.

He’s how I did it but I’m sure there’s an easier way.  To link my bank to the app I clicked the logo on top right corner of app while logged in. That took me to Schwab assistant.  I typed transfer from bank account and clicked the bot reply  that best fit.  That took me to a spot in app that allowed me to update my banking info so I didn’t need to take a photo of a check. Who uses checks anymore????  This seemed to work for me but there’s 3 day delay for funds to show up which I’m hoping is because it’s my first deposit.,0
Just don’t compare these rates to IBKR lol,-1

"That is the insidiousness of eToro.  Their schtick is not to steal your money, but to steal your money FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.

"If you're new, I strongly suggest practicing with Webull's simulator (paper trading) for a few months. When ready to make the leap, use a cash account.

If I may request help here as well, I am also confused by this. Originally the “variable b amount” auto filled as $8000, but I changed it to 0 based on what my 2023 notice of assessment said.

I opened my fhsa in 2023 and contributed the max amount in both ‘23 and ‘24.

"Very well reasoned.  One thing though, the value of trusting your broker is worth the fees you might save with other brokers.

I consider Schwab a value-add and, as such, don’t mind making less interest and slightly higher fees than certain others.  It’s not unreasonable to me.

Plus, they earn it — with level of Service with actual professionals, quicker trades (I’ve tested this), and no issues or fears of having full control over your own money.  

Schwab, I believe, legitimately strives to be excellent.  Leave room for people being human.  Policies, though, are strong.  Majority of people are friendly and actually helpful.  24/7 a phone call away.  They meet you where you are, as if actively taking on your perspective as a client.

That list could be much longer, how they earn it over others.",0
The deadline for them to merge is March 31st so it needs to be before that or the whole deal falls apart. They already extended once before and they can't do it again.

"Not OP but I switched from TurboTax to SimpleTax (before the Wealthsimple acquisition) because:

* I think Wealthsimple Tax's UI has been better and simpler to use than TurboTax, and offers better help resources if I don't understand something.
* Wealthsimple Tax is honestly free to use compared to TurboTax which has a free option with a lot of asterisks to make sure people end up paying (employment expenses, investment income, donations and medical expenses all disqualify you from being a ""simple tax return"" and force you into a paid tier).
* Intuit is a horrible business actively lobbying governments against making tax returns simpler/automatic. I'd much rather support Wealthsimple, even if I did have to pay for my tax return with them.",1
Don’t gamble in tax sheltered accounts because you were just screwing yourself over.  Gamble in non-tax sheltered accounts and then you can actually write off the losses because you’re terrible at trading.,0
"Thanks for the comment.

100% understood. I use both and each has its strengths. But ToS is by far more customizable and extendable. It had a 10 year head start and has had more development put into it. Hearing the guys that developed both I get the strong impression that they weren’t trying to just make a new version of ToS with Tasty. I think they were looking for the most streamlined platform for advanced retail traders of a certain type.,1
I am surprised that they offered you anything to retain your business. I seriously doubt Fidelity even considers RH a competitor.,0
">I am new to trading. I have heard that brokers only keep those customers accounts who keep losing and the total withdrawn amount is less than the total deposit amount.

Completely untrue. It's not in a broker's interest to keep only losing accounts. The losers eventually go broke and no longer generate any revenue for the broker. Brokers want successful clients who grow their accounts, trade more frequently and generate ever increasing commissions and margin interest.

>The moment total withdrawal amount gets somewhere close to total deposit amount ""Fraud investigation"" starts and the account closes with money gone forever.

No. Brokers monitor for illegal activity like money laundering. There are posts here occasionally about accounts being locked for fraud investigation. We don't know the details, but it's possible they deposited money and tried to withdraw it before it cleared or had several rejected deposits. 

> I want to know if there are people who have withdrawn more than the total deposit amount.

I have withdrawn more money from my TDA account than I ever deposited. No issues.",0

Definitely ask for at least a level 3 Options ability but make sure you have enough Capital to cover any costs in case of assignment if you’re selling naked Options. This way you’ll be able to do more complex Options like butterflies on the/ES which are future’s on the SPX mini’s. If you haven’t gone through any of the Options education programs yet I suggest you do so and there are also webinars they offer on Options Strategies and education.,0
"So, no big deal to lose this money.  Maybe it was a hooker who took the money because she thought you were paying her a lot?  If it is so small to notice why are you wasting time posting here?

"A few thoughts to this. Firstly, in my opinion I would argue investing in virgin Galactic is more risky than Lloyds and not really sure why you think Lloyds is risky anyway. 

To be pedantic, I don't think you can call a LISA and investment. It's a savings account with some perks. 

Investing in the stock market can increase your capital but not necessarily your income. Sure the money is coming to you so it's income in a sense but not consistent reliable money which is what a mortgage broker cares about. 

As for the index stocks it sounds like for you that's the way to go. They're safer yes and they bring decent returns for long term investments. If you're looking for big money immediately you're not in the right place, investing is money over time and with stocks you're weighing up returns over risk. Are you going to be checking in everyday on your portfolio to see if it's time to sell or buy? Or do you want to invest some money and feel free to forget about it until you want to *withdraw*? 

Also, think of your exit. Is your investments via a S&S ISA?",0

The lack of support for QESI in your RESP offering is also not mentioned anywhere on your website (as far as I can tell) - and yet you let Quebec residents open such an account, effectively letting them forgo a critical benefit of an RESP (the Provincial grant!), which is borderline irresponsible in my opinion.

The common element to both situations: WS made the conscious decision to hide those limitations from your Quebec customers, instead of being honest and up front with them.

I get that doing business in Quebec is more complicated vs the rest of Canada and that sometimes you can't offer parity. All I ask is that you are honest, open and up front with what's unavailable.",-1

"By the way, which public hospital is your mum admitted to?

1. Get a detailed report and data on the major hospitalization and post-hospitalization cost claims by IP and IP riders, and break down if additional tests and scans actually improve the recovery of patients. Just because IP riders claim more than non IP riders does not mean increased cost does not help in medical case recovery. It may be that there is no choice but to go to private, which has high costs, to save a life in urgency. Without such data insight it is not possible to dismiss private health care as wasteful.
2. increase the premiums/riders/basic MediSave for people who have chosen detrimental habits like smoking, vaping, and drugs. Excludes sugar. sodium or fat intake,

Tracking  is via legal purchases or consumption , or arrests

increase the premiums of people who have committed crimes like scamming and white-collar crimes involving a certain threshold amount. Canning is introduced for scamming. why not increase the premiums? China has more draconian  blacklist excluding high speed transport and other privileges

4. Segregate IP plans with frills like luxury meals like lobsters and Angus steaks and private suites with plasma TVs.

"I'm scratching my head here. Kiting usually takes longer to kill mobs than killing them in melee and only is necessary because the class is too squishy. Since kiting means running around and only being able to do smaller amounts of damage every now and then, it usually takes longer to kill. In my head that means the need to kite equals slower leveling, not fast leveling. But maybe I was doing it wrong... Never liked kiting.

My endgame class was monk and my first lvl 50 was a bloodmage. Bloodmage was really nice, underwater breathing, invisibility, I was able to sneak through almost everything. Combat? Head on heal-tanking, no problem.

"I'd like to give some positive insight here. My family has been with Merrill Lynch for over 40+ years dating back to when my grandfather first started investing. Hundreds of thousands of dollars invested through my family and Merrill Lynch. Always been a positive experience and their customer service is top notch. I to this day also use their platform with an account that values over $25k+. I will attest that during all of the fiasco going on with Robinhood restricting trading for various equities, Merrill Lynch had kept those same equities fully open with no trading regulations in place for well over a week. I enjoy the platform and the MarketPro tool they offer. Like anything it has a learning curve at first, but if you traditionally understand any broker interface this wouldn't be hard to grasp. The tools are outstanding and the market research is what puts Merrill over the top imo. 

I do however advice against trading options there as every option trade costs $0.65 per contract. That's an extra $1.3 to factor in to whatever strike price you are targeting for your call or put option.

For this reason I use Webull. Free option trading and I would say it's the second most easiest platform for new option traders to grasp and understand.",1

Same here. Had a couple of meetings  with Fidelity advisers and they gave some good advise like telling me I had to diversify more which I did need to.

Creating closed code, or proprietary code, for TradeStation strategies involves developing strategies in TradeStation's proprietary languages, such as EasyLanguage, and then compiling the code in a way that protects it from being accessed or copied by others. TradeStation allows strategy developers to share their work without revealing the underlying code through the use of protected or encrypted files.

Here’s how you can typically go about creating and distributing closed code strategies in TradeStation:

1. **Develop Your Strategy**: Use EasyLanguage to create your trading strategy, which is TradeStation's programming language designed for trading strategies and indicators.

2. **Protect Your Code**: TradeStation offers a feature to protect your EasyLanguage code. When you are ready to distribute your strategy, you can use the `Protect` function within the TradeStation development environment to encrypt your code. This makes the code unreadable to others, hence preserving your intellectual property.

3. **Compile and Export**: After protecting your strategy, compile it into an executable form (.ELD file) that can be used in TradeStation but cannot be reverse-engineered easily. This file can be distributed to others who can use the strategy within their TradeStation platform without accessing the source code.

4. **Documentation and Support**: Since users won’t be able to view or modify the code, provide detailed documentation about how the strategy works and what inputs or parameters can be adjusted. Offering good support can also be crucial for closed code strategies.

5. **Distribute Your Strategy**: You can distribute your compiled and protected files directly to your customers or through TradeStation's Strategy Network, where users can browse and purchase strategies.

If these options aren't visible or available in your version of TradeStation, or if the process has changed, contacting TradeStation support directly would be the best way to get precise and updated instructions tailored to the current software version and features.",0
"The box usually isn't too risky, so the margin should be low.

Margin brokers mostly don't care if you run out of cash, because they will readily lend it.  But why?  Because, if needed, they'll liquidate your positions until they get comfortable -- so it's not a ""cash"" question, it's a ""risk"" question.  And risk is essentially the amount of potential account variability (losses, mainly) versus account value.

And because the box isn't usually highly variable in value (relative to notional amount), that explains the low-risk/low-margin treatment.

If you sell a box and don't have the cash at expiration but your account value/risk is still fine, then the only thing you'd expect from them is to start tracking the interest you owe them (instead of to the options box market maker) -- because risk is what they really care about, not a negative cash balance.

How can it go wrong?

- If there's massive rate volatility or financial system problems, they might spike the margin requirement, causing a need for liquidation to resolve the margin level

- If the account value falls too much (eg, from a withdrawal or because the risk assets -- possibly bought with box proceeds -- lost too much value, etc)",0

"I did it online. I first sign up to get my ME Roth IRA account open and then when it was approved. I then started a direct transfer on the ME side to get my money from fidelity.

I banked entirely with BoFA so it make senses that I kept all of my money together. Also, nice if you're currently a preferred member. My one advice to you is that you sell your mutual funds or whatever you have on your Roth IRA in fidelity before making the transfer. Then you can buy the funds again over at ME.

And thanks, that is what I figured as well about the liquidity. I just read so many comments where people say you’ll get screwed with Market orders but that doesn’t help at all when the specifics of the order aren’t provided.  Sure, wide spreads Market orders is a terrible idea.

My current strategy has been so simple and lucrative in paper trading that I’m trying to figure out what I’m missing since everyone isn’t doing this.  Even if paper trading is giving me better fills that would only account for maybe 20% of my profits, assuming the fill is the ask price at most.   Even in paper trading I’ll get screwed sometimes because the price will fluctuate before my order fills and i’ll be down but it bounces back quickly or I just cut my losses.   

IV makes a huge difference.  Trading SPX after noon-ish things start getting dangerous.  But 9:30-11:30 it is so easy to make a quick $500 by just catching a nice little trend change.  Get in, get out.  Don’t be greedy, don’t push it.  I’ll often miss out on another $500 by selling too early but, hell, making a quick $300-500, sometimes more with single trades like 10 times a day, even if you take a hit on a couple it is still easy enough to make some real money.  In using $50k-$100k in capital I average like $2500 a day.  2 weeks I’ve made $30k.  That is no yolo stuff, playing as if it was real money.  Seems too good to be true but even if I can make half of that with live trading I’m pretty happy.  

I want to cash out my 401k to do this but I don’t want to take the tax and early withdrawal penalty only to find that the live trading experience with these quick market orders is way different.",0
I did etrade- ultimately. Not as good but acceptable. Alot of research features that were in TD do not exist that I can find. I give it a 7 out 10. But the interface is at least easy to look at.,0

"As others have said, don't sell up now, just switch your future investments to all-world. I'm confident S&P will recover eventually though and when it does I would consider moving it across (even if all-world grows slightly slower during good financial times).",0

"Wow, that's not good. It's almost like they're trying to chase customers away on purpose. Like they don't want forex or futures business. 
My forex charts still frozen.",0
"I keep my registered account at WS, but for non reg IBKR has much more products. Just the lower margin rate makes them a better option. Also I just feel more comfortable to have multiple accounts with multiple providers in case of an issue. Maybe it’s overly paranoid.

I also use quest trade for my corp, and can confirm that it’s the worst of the 3.",1
Good thing is that I don’t have any trades open. Currently I’ve been trading futures without any issues on thinkorswim.  Your saying that if my account was transitioning this weekend I won’t be able to trade futures ???,0
"I don't like Charles Schwab costumer service 

They all end up telling me that they don't have time to assist me because they have other incoming calls",-1
"This looks like a credit and a short put but the -48% implies you didn't sell it at .75 but much lower than that.  In tastytrade, you can check the position chain to see what you got credited for originally and so on",0
"Webull is amazing, don't listen to him. Public.com is the only other that comes close to webull",1
"For me the SIPP was great value as you can pick what you want , other providers dont really offer this , instead they have a set amount of funds.

Might be worth mentioning to the new people looking to open a SIPP that the Goverment ( HMRC if UK ) will contribute 25% of what you add/contribute to your SIPP.  takes something like 6 weeks but they just add it to your account.

On the other Hand it is also worth checking if theres anything in the PLUS section you actually want - could save a bit there too.  Personally I dont find PLUS that attractive especially for a SIPP , but thats my preference.

It isn't a market crash - yet. Trump isn't finished destroying the economy. What I find amusing is Jim Cramer from CNN saying he feels like a sucker for believing Trump on tariffs. What a moron. He also didn't see the crash coming in 2008 caused by Republican. Why is he still on TV?,0

"Just started using it. Today I just put my first buy and then I cant do anything else as the Client Portal is lagging like hell (i dont see the fucking chart, i dont see the fucking tickers of my positions, i dont see my watchlist).

For fuck sake I'm even using the pro version, what the fuck is wrong with this shit broker? I thought I was using the best of both worlds.

If it wasnt for the premarket and AH opportunities, which is the only reason why I switched from Trading212 (runs perfectly), I would already trashed this shit. Fuckin unbelievable. 

How am I even suppose to trade with such lag? Is this a joke?",-1

"When you place a market order for something that trades on the exchange (stock etf etc) the broker finds a counterparty and executes a legally binding agreement. That usually happens in a fraction of a second during market hours. Once you form a legally binding agreement, you can’t just cancel it.

That legally binding agreement states when the cash will be sent to the seller and the asset delivered to the buyer. That historically was three business days later and now is one business day for most assets.

"Financial institutions (banks and brokers) have cracked down on this in recent years. You will not be able to get around this for TD Ameritrade and for large banks like Chase etc. Interactive Brokers is even stricter, requiring you to provide physical proof of residence and address. There are probably some smaller brokers out there with more lax requirements. Good luck.",-1
"Good, 100% better to use the ISA. 
Therefore, don’t go with a Distribution ETF, that’ll give you dividends. The Accumulation ETFs auto reinvest the dividends essentially without you seeing them or doing anything. Meaning the share price will increase.",0
It's not illegal in Canada. That is nonsense. Note that it is considered a revenue and not a capital gain or loss so not admissible to the 50% of your tax rate.,0
"I’m debating moving to fidelity to consolidate with what I have through my employer.  Though honestly not much of a fan of fidelity either (though I’ve not used it much for trading to be fair, more just judging navigating their UI for 401k/HSA etc.)

I’m generally a passive boglehead investor so it doesn’t sound like Schwab would be *awful* for my use case.  But reading around here I’m certainly considering alternatives. 

I’ve also not yet researched about how smooth transitioning away is, can’t be arsed with that being a ball ache.",-1
"Correct, desktop is absolute rubbish. Can’t even load an option chain out 2 1/2 standard deviation. Buggy as fuck I also noticed when I was using webull, trading SPX and spy i.e. highly liquid, my fills were far worse than trading with IBKR.",-1
"Hi mate thanks for the advice. I’m now down like 29% haha invested at the worst possible time. I have like £1500 to spare at the moment so was thinking of maybe slowly buying the dip in sp500 using dollar cost averaging, buying like £10/20 a day. Have it just in a cash isa at the moment Do you know much about dollar cost averaging?",0
"I really hope that this is the answer. I just accepted the Free OPRA data, so am curious to see tomorrow. I have the same issues, where last price doesn't match the chart i am looking at. It is so frustrating and makes it impossible to trade options on the paper account. I really hope the OPRA data fixes this.",0
"Use IBKR desktop app, it has much better tradingview integration.",1
"This message just showed on Schwab's message service !!!!! If they can not execute trades, they should get out of this business.  I got there due to TD sale.  I am in the process of closing my account with Schwab.  The sooner I do it, the better for me.  I suggest others also should leave.

"Another great feature of the T212 ISA, is it is flexible, so you can withdraw and re-deposit if need be.",1
"As someone who is not an active trader and never used the app, I miss TD dearly for it's superb website design. You could tell it's designed by people who placed themselves in the role of the User. Everything was so convenient and so pleasant that we took it all for granted and never even thought about the design itself. We just used it as if it's tailored to us individually. I wonder what those TD employees who are now Schwab employees think.",1
Argo Blockchain (ARB) looks like a good buy right now. NASDAQ listing coming very soon which is likely to increase the share price in the short-medium term through extra visibility and availability on other platforms like robin hood etc. They also have a new mining data centre coming online early next year in Texas (though they're a British company).

"I don’t see any reason to be annoyed that they offer a product. You don’t have to use it. I like webull

Interesting. I didn’t know robinhood had added that level of extensive event contracts. Or that webull had. Hm I wonder why I haven’t seen it. Haven’t been using my robinhood account

I did see the election one on robinhood months ago and used it but aside from that I didn’t know they were offering ones for stuff like the jobs data releases. Interesting",1
Bullshit they seized my account and refused to release it and refuse a written explanation for the seizure and say it under review I’d never tell anyone to use them as their broker fkn crooks,-1
It’s free. I only mention it because some early suggestions were that Schwab was holding off transitioning ToS users until later in the process.,0
"If I put in $5000, and the associated bonus is $100, is that $100 a month? or $100 total. 2% return is pretty terrible with current CD rates. But $100 a month seems too good to be true...

  
Edit: Okay I get it, 3.75% with their cash management, and then another 2% in bonus cash so 5.75% annual returns on the 5k, which is actually better than any CD I could find",0

"I too am considering Schwab even though I haven't been directly affected. I never used the CMA, but did consider it at one point, but I don't like having all my eggs in one basket.

What other things are you finding that are different and what functionality is missing?",0
"If you call, you will at least get a straight answer. 

I called on 10-OCT-2024 and the rep explained that any electronic deposits (literally anything than mailing or hand delivering a paper check to cash) now has a clearance time of up to 16 business days (vs 1-5 before). Likewise, debit cards stopped going out early September.

The rep sounded genuinely sympathetic to the problem, which was appreciated. I knew he had no control over it and couldn't have gotten an answer to when these policies will revert no matter how hard he tried.

Now for personal conjecture part - they are trying to do as much sweeping under the rug as possible. Just like with Chase - it was a flaw in **their** system that allowed bogus checks to be cashed. So while they aren't to blame for people committing credit card fraud, they still aren't bothering to take any corrective and preventative actions. 

I'm guessing that means whoever built their software was a 3rd party contractor and not in-house staff. So the delay is going to be for them to go through the super long and super bureaucratic process of finding a contractor who is the lowest bidder but still able to do a better job than the last one :-/",-1
"I loved Schwab until they decided to shut my husband out of his account for over two weeks due to the fact that he sent a $1k international wire (and this was during the holidays too - Thanksgiving). He wasn't even able to log in and get access to his money or trade. After that, we have been working our way slowly to exiting from them.",0

"Your situation sounds very specific to the US side. IBKR should be good for you but I am based in the southern hemisphere so they're not as good for me for the lag. Their platform TWS does have a pretty steep learning curve though once you get used to it they're excellent. I would have stayed with them if not for their lag and their customer service who copy and paste from a template regardless of your issue so that's to be warned. Payment wise they're pretty good they will give you a date straight up when you should expect it in your account but it's normally 2-3 business days and they have a much stringent fraud prevention and security measures so you'd probably have your funds held a bit longer than you expect for a standard procedure so that's a heads up for you but overall they are an excellent platform that tells you what to expect.

Not sure about Fidelity. I can't open an account with them on the southern hemisphere.

Moomoo released my funds rather quickly after I emailed them, probably partly because I am based in the southern hemisphere where they have a separate office. I can't say for sure but I do have to give credits where credits due since I got mine resolved although the customer service experience was far from pleasant. I can only say I hold a higher bar because I came from customer service background myself and they need a lot of work on that front.",-1
"The ETF I buy is on IBIS2, so how to I set the trade so that it uses the cheapest fee ?

Gettex and IBIS 2 (Xetra) are both lowest fee in EUR exchange, but I am trying to understand how to set me trade, because I see no options during the buy that allow me to define an exchange or a routing for example. I use both mobile app and web platform, not the desktop software that has all the options.",0
"Terrible situation! I hope it gets sorted ASAP for you mate. 

I know this isn't helpful to say right now, but maybe consider InvestEngine, especially if you're just investing in ETFs. Overall they're much more reliable and helpful than T212. They're also free. 

(I know it's cash) But it took 2.5 working days for my Principality ISA to transfer to InvestEngine. 

I use T212 and IE. I only use T212 for individual stock picks, partly because of their poor customer service, which I've also experienced first hand.",-1
"Man, I wish I didn't know this, but I can't unread it. I love Schwab's customer service, but I abhor Opus Dei and the Federalist Society, the two main groups Leonardo Leo is behind. If Schwab donates an equal amount to, say, George Soros, I'd say maybe they're at least being fair. But it doesn't cancel out the financial props to Leonardo Leo, of all people.

What's a good one for traveling? Still TOS? Probably just need a good laptop because my chrome book wouldn't let me download TOS,0
"Exact same! I called since I thought they need to approve on their end. Turns out if you have the Schwab One brokerage account debit card, you won’t be able to add it on any digital wallet. The one that’s tied to the Investor checking account will work though and can be added to the wallet. The rep said it’s because it’s a different bank/issuer… something like that.",0
""" The type of information required of a broker is spelled out in Rule 17a-3(a)(17) of the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seact1934.asp).

The rule specifically requires the customer's name, SSN/TIN, mailing address, telephone number, date of birth, employment status (including occupation and whether the customer is an [associated person](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/associatedperson.asp) of an exchange, a broker, or a [dealer](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dealer.asp)), annual income, net worth (excluding the value of a primary residence), and investment objectives.

Tax compliance is one reason that brokers need personal information. Investors need to report capital gains, losses, and dividends to the IRS. And brokers must have this data in order to send the required forms each year.

The SEC lists three other reasons why brokers are required to ask for personal information. They are [suitability](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/suitable.asp), record-keeping requirements, and anti-terrorist/[anti-money laundering (AML)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aml.asp) laws. ""

- from Investopedia

I think because Merrill has advisory services, their questions regarding suitability would be wider than say a RobinHood because they need to gauge what other services to offer to you.

That information is also used so they know how to negotiate terms with you.   I was offered $\_\_\_,  \_\_% margin rate, \_\_ fees waivers etc. to move my accounts over.  I decided not to do it, but used their terms to negotiate better terms at my broker.  If you're just trying to open a generic basic account, I don't know why they're asking for value of your home,",0
"The All-World will include the S&P500, and is roughly 60% weighted to US Equities.    
  
You can go to Invesco's website, (or any ETF / fund for that matter) like Vanguard, iShares, whatever -- And you can see the EXACT holdings, the precise weighting, you can see the fees, the Geography they cover, the exchanges they are sold at, what the tickers are.   You can also see all the different funds they offer. You can do more research, beyond looking at the funds on T212.  

Expand your scope a bit, and remember to not rush into anything.  Stocks can be risky.  But equip yourself with some more knowledge. 

[https://www.invesco.com/uk/en/financial-products/etfs/invesco-ftse-all-world-ucits-etf-acc.html](https://www.invesco.com/uk/en/financial-products/etfs/invesco-ftse-all-world-ucits-etf-acc.html)",0
"Sorry for the vague question!   
Although the FIDELITY Cash Management Account offers 2.72% APY, and the STAR ONE account offers 3.25% APY, and both offer debit card, **—**my question basically concerned experiences that people have had with each one, that might put one in an advantage over the other...

...but I guess the higher interest rate would always trump one over the other.  
  
/Thank you!",0
"Merrill automatic investment plans do not take fees when buying vanguard funds. Maybe for the first one they do? But I’ve had mine going for 2 years now going biweekly and don’t pay the $20 fee. Same for dividend reinvestment. Merrill’s platform isn’t the best, but it is worth it to max out the preferred rewards and then keep the rest of your money elsewhere.",1
"I think people still sell boxes on reg-T, but the cash proceeds are offset by a corresponding increase in margin requirement.

So, I think the typical use case is like when you deposit 50k USD, buy 80k marginable stocks and then to reduce your cost on the 30k (eg, from offered 6.8% margin rate down to maybe market +30bps, so maybe to around 4.6%), then you'd sell enough box to cover the 30k cash and leaving your remaining margin about the same (and getting your cash close to zero, but not too high or too low).

Another alternative is to not buy 80k of stocks but to buy 80k worth of stock as synthetic long options spreads or similar leverage.  Eg, if a stock is trading at 100/sh spot, then I could buy 8 synthetic long spreads around the 40 strike, using up my 50k on 80k worth of stock exposure.  I don't know the details of how the margining works compared to stocks on reg-T, though.  This can achieve the stock exposure and leverage in one transaction.  But there can be other issues involved like taxes.

Some potential limitations to call out are the exercise style of the options -- I don't think an American style box will margin the same as European style (although people don't usually want the early assignment anyway).  Also I think selling a securities box in a retirement account is doable, but I'm not sure what limitations might exist.

But anyway, selling a box without portfolio margin should work at least in several cases, especially to get funding cheaper than broker margin loans.",0
"You need to have your attorneys send them a mail with action required.  We had to do this one time to them and they answer IMMEDIATELY.

Fidelity is a good brokerage, but they cross the line sometimes by closing accounts without notice.  I use my attorneys from my trust matters to deal with this crap when it happens.  

Also, I highly recommend you use multiple brokerages such as Schwab and Vanguard as well, split up your investments between each.

Finally, use multiple banks to store intermediate funds that you use regularly and have backup local credit unions.

If you are at home a lot and have it secured, I'd also recommend holding a bit of cash and some gold/silver bars... not too much, but enough to get you by if something bad happens.

Always be prepared for this kind of crap, it's only going to get worse.  But you DO need some attorneys on your side - they don't charge me unless I use them... and Fidelity is the worst in my experience pulling this crap.

Edit: BTW, Schwab has been the best overall - never had to deal with crap from them and they've been quite good on the phone when called.",-1
I hate Schwab. The TDA app was so far superior it seriously makes me sad to login to my account now. The research tools Schwab offers are just terrible. I'm hoping to find another brokerage to move my account to.,1
"Damn youve lost all in my account a few times over then. 

Next time Schwab or ToS goes down ill definitely ask for less fees, thats a great idea. IDK the futures few but I would love to ¢50 rather than ¢65 when trading options.",0
"I thought the limit was £25k for US stocks and £12.5k for UK stocks.

So there's a _""bug""_  which limits fractional sell orders at £12.5k?

Jesus this platform gets worse and worse, next freetrade.io will be as bad as Robinhood. I'll be selling everything off and leaving this platform soon.",-1
"I could go on and on …like highlighting of selected elements which the app does in some contexts in others not or different, ""add"" buttons for watchlists or search fields are nested in navigation bars at the end, the whole watchlist management is weird… you can not unselect in the collection when clicking the ""heart"" button of the itemview and if the list gets long, then you can not scroll to the bottom and hit ""done""… hitting ""enter"" doesnt work…

I mean IB is a publicly traded billion company. What are they doing? 

Playing Candy Crush is more accurate than using the Desktop app or mobile (same issues) for Mac for my savings? Seriously?",-1
"When you buy to close, do you proceed on the same fashion?  Ie start a new options trade.  And where it says “sell to open” so you choose “buy to close?”  I’m nervous about closing a covered call... 
it’s very simple on Robinhood and E*TRADE lol",0
Happy to see all these questions because I see no reason to “trust” in copy trading. I am so sceptical about it considering the fact that on eToro everyone can be an investor acting as professional investor without having any official confirmation of graduation in finance or even passing successfully the secondary school…. People trust their money on people who owns sometimes positions opened years ago and maintained just to remain green…,-1
"Hey there! Welcome to the world of futures trading! It can definitely feel like a wild ride at first, especially with the stop loss stuff. 

1. About your first question, if your stop losses and target prices were removed, it could be because you set them as day orders, which can expire at the end of the trading day. A good way to avoid running into this is to set them as GTC (Good Till Canceled) orders if you want them to stick around longer. As for your long position being active without stop losses, you might want to double-check in the trades tab to see what's going on.

2. For the issue with modifying your order, that can happen if your position is too close to the market price or if there’s high volatility. It’s not an uncommon situation, but it's definitely a headache when you can't control it! 

To prevent these issues in the future, make sure to monitor your trades regularly and familiarize yourself with how Webull handles orders. Try setting your stop losses a bit further away to give yourself some breathing room. Good luck, and may your trading journey be a profitable one!",0
"People are acting like the td app wasn't dogshit too. 

If you're actively trading at all there is no reason outside of laziness to not use ToS",-1
"I know Freetrade likes to have a bit of fun, but imo this is going a bit too far...",-1
"Hey, I ran into this myself does the top left of your 1099 say Apex Clearing like mine did. I called in and they said to use Apex clearing on turbo tax it worked for me. I had another account that said Webull Financial, and the Omnibus Turbo Tax worked for that. A bit clunky for my taste but at least I was able to file.",-1
"Not all employers will accept a rollover from a previous employer's plan, so check with your new employer before making any decisions. IF your 401k plan at Fidelity allows these rollovers (roll-ins?) of another plan's assets... Initiate on the Fidelity side. It's easy and Fidelity will handle everything. Don't bother contacting Vanguard.",1
"After being with TDA and seeing Schwab I have 1 question: Why did the SEC allow this merger/buyout of TDA clients. Schwab doesn't provide the information about stocks that TDA provided even though according to them ""EVERYTHING IS GOING TO STAY THE SAME"". NOPE! Their platform is junk. I would like to know what person in the SEC got paid to let this happen, because there's no way any intelligent person would have investigated these 2 platforms and said ""sure you can continue with your buyout and wreak havoc on small  investors"". I didn't choose Schwab for a reason, and here we are.",-1
Thanks. I was hoping you were referring to the TD Ameritrade Mobile app and not Thinkorswim. I have and use Thinkorswim and I don’t like it. I literally only use it to see the balance on my other TD account so I don’t have to log out and back in on TDA app to check.,0
"I wrote last week to the Schwab API team and this is what they responded:

We are still working out couple things, once that is done we will then begin onboarding individual developers to start using Schwab Trader API. We estimate we will be able to release Schwab Trader API sometime by the end of the first quarter, dates are still tentative.
I've added your email to the priority review list.

You would be able to track your application approval on Schwab developer portal under API Products at the top -> click on the ""Trader API – Individual” in the top right corner it will show the current status of your API request.",0

Is it in the ""Nofitications"" ? No it's not.

Is it under iBot with permanently has a red dot on it ? No its not there.

Should I go into settings ? Doesn't make sense... but let me check anyway. No it's not.

Is it under ""Account Management"" ? oh wait... I need to do a step up authentication now, but returned to the home screen.

Let me go back into More/AcctMgmt. Ah there it is... the ""Message Center"".

But the msg center has no messages! oh wait... I have to tap the on the hamburger icon to select ""Corporate Actions"" and there it is.

Unhelpful msg which i don't care about, but have spent 10 mins just to get to it. This happens every time.

Makes me wonder... has no one at IBKR ever tried using the app at all ?",-1
"Thanks for trying that out. It is very interesting. 

For a different issue I have used several browsers and cleared cookies, but I have not tried that yet with Fidelity. So this is not a big deal for me, but I guess it was big enough to comment.  Let me also say that the Summary, Positions, and Balances may have improved, and somehow I did not post that. ;-)

Expanding or contracting browser zoom level does not change the format for me, but just makes the stuff smaller or larger. My Windows Scale is 100%.

To be clear, it is the table that starts this way that I call payload:

"What's better about being on trading 212? I started opening a stocks and shares ISA on there but haven't finished it, I was going to open on on freetrade so I could Keep everything in one place, would it be better to switch to 212 for my ISA?",0
"Cadet PI here, I assign weights to my holdings and rotate in and out of sectors, regions and assets when I think or feel market conditions have changed enough. I set targets for most of my holdings.

But I've seen sooo many other PIs with stale portfolios. Some of them just basically got lucky with Nvidia or Bitcoin a few years ago and are ridding that wave until their portfolio crashes 50% or more. You can spot these PIs becuse they have few holdings, maybe 1-15, and risk scores of 5 or more over the last year. They'll never admit this publicly of course, and they post garbage they copy from other sources to make them look like they know what's going on.

And there are a handfull of okish PIs with consistent performance.

In the end we all use the astrology equivalent in the financial world to try and predict what's next, which will work from time to time, but over the long run no PI will match the SP500. In the short term some will greatly outperform  because they're at the right place at the right time.

PIs that just buy tech stocks, be it on dips, dca, or whatever, will have great performance until they don't. At that point they'll double down on a losing strategy and drag their copiers into mediocre performance at best.",0
"I also have an IRA and non-IRA account with TD and a IRA with Fidelity.

Fidelity doesn't seem as ""trader friendly"" as TD but other than that not sure what there is to say, they are both zero-commission and for basic stock transactions either is fine.    

Personally I wouldn't switch from TD to Fidelity unless there is something specific about TD that you don't like

Anyway, if the CS web interface sucks I would suggest you use the ToS app, either desktop and/or mobile.",-1
"This is the type of answer I think I am looking for. It's no knock at all I appreciate you! I have a good amount of capital imo, will definitely look into the etfs though, and start adding more to the big tech manufacturers first. Thank you for some solid advice, these thoughts were bouncing around on what to do in my head, but you helped with this response. Those ones you didn't like were given to free by Webull, so I'm glad I'm doing something right haha",0

"This submission appears to be about Fidelity support or customer service.

This subreddit is a fan-run community.

Consider posting to the official Fidelity support subreddit at /r/fidelityinvestments for support.

"Yes, you'll want to contact the Trade Service Team at 800-435-9050 and if you had an order that was cancelled that they can reasonably determine would have filled if it were not for this issue, they said they will make an adjustment.  If you had an open pending order that you did not cancel, they probably won't (according to the person I spoke to at Schwab).

Looks like orders are processing now that most of my premium is trash.",0
"Not sure of the specific rule, but not available to green card holders at this time.  Use an ETF like FBTC or another platform like Coinbase.",0
"What you’re looking at is an ISO order, it’s an order type used by institutions to sweep as much liquidity as possible below a certain price across multiple exchanges. It’s used in an effort to prevent front running by HFT whenever very large institutional buying/selling is happening. The price always comes through a bit weird in the T&S data on TOS, I imagine because these large orders are being filled at multiple prices across multiple exchanges and it’s not an order type that’s within the NBBO, but that’s what this anomaly is. 

There were similar ISO orders coming through T&S on SPY all day, 126k lots consistently and I tallied about 15-20 of them with the price listed on each one being 543.8155 (which SPY was never at today). Here are some links to ISO order explanations and how to understand them, [link 1](https://www.warriortrading.com/intermarket-sweep-order/), [link 2](https://tiomarkets.com/article/intermarket-sweep-order-guide), [link 3](https://www.cheddarflow.com/blog/comprehensive-guide-to-intermarket-sweep-orders/). 

Hope this is helpful!",0
What was it like moving your roth over to Schwab. I’ve only stayed with ML because I’ve been with them and BOA forever and I don’t want to stress about moving my IRAS over.  One thing that drives me nuts is that they don’t have a money market for cash sitting there that I can find. correct me if I’m wrong about that.,-1
"When the switch happened, I couldn't believe the difference between Ameritrade and Schwab, but I decided to give it a week or two. I finally called Schwab, will say they have good customer service, told the guy in the phone it looks like a 4th grader created the app, he sorta laughed. I mentioned several things and all he said was we should eventually see upgrades.
The only ""upgrade"" I've seen is if I make a deposit, it's in there instantly instead of having to wait until the next business day.",1
"Cash available for trade means exactly that. You can use it to purchase securities, bonds, etc. That includes FXAIX.

A Good Faith Violation occurs when you SELL a security with funds that have not fully settled yet.  Fidelity is saying that deposit that was recently made has not fully settled yet. They are letting you trade with it for now, but until that settlement finishes you can’t sell that position. (So no day trading!)

Now… how long until those funds actually settle?  If you use Fidelity to pull money out of your external bank, it can take 3 weeks to fully settle. If you instead push the money from your external bank into Fidelity, it will settle in 24-73 hours typically. You can also wire money into Fidelity and have same day settlement typically. 

That Good Faith note is simply a warning not to sell before the original deposit settles. As long as you are simply buying for long term holding, it has literally zero impact to you.",0
"Your forgetting the fact that EQ bank will give you a terrible exchange rate. IBKR has the literal exact exchange rate listed on Google sometimes better. What I recommend is you transfer CAD to IBKR then convert CAD to USD (no norbert gambit needed) then if you really want no fees you can select to transfer native USD to your bank then from native USD bank to Wealthsimple.

If your depositing less then 5k then don’t bother with the hassle honestly.",1
"Go look up how ACH transactions are processed, it’s not exclusive to webull. They have to go through clearing houses like fifth thirds bank, etc. each hand that touches it adds time. Until they get the all clear from those parties they are not willing to let you have access to the money. It’s the same reason your paycheck deposits 2 full days before you can access it in most cases. Some banks however will give you the money early if you’ve been having regular deposits from the same place and can show an established pattern.",0
"If you have a statement or a report from IBKR that states that the deduction is Withholding Tax, it's irrelevant if they have paid it to HMRC - you can claim it back.

And separately, if you do have that statement that states that it is Withholding Tax on UK non-REIT companies, I'd consider including that in a formal complaint to IBKR to avoid it happening again.",-1
"Hey r/moomoo_official , I'm fairly new on the Australian platform trading U.S stock, can you look at hotkeys/shortcuts to Follow Ask 1 and Follow Bid 1 in the price slot, at the moment there are hot keys to input these figures but it also locks at that price.

This would be need to be able to be used during pre/aftermarket trading while in the limit order type.

Or offset keys, being able to set a buy/sell offset +or- at a personal setting of say 0.01/0.02/0.03, the existing keys are +/- 1 which i have found can mean 0.0001 and not as helpful.

With these 2 it would be a pretty good set up, and would post mine if you can do it.

Or happy to be corrected I have not found these yet.

Cheers.",0
"I used to love td, I might be moving to ibkr which I used to hate but schawb is even worse. I sold some shares and it has been a week and my cash keeps saying 0. To get the money out, had to do cash + borrowing. Should have taken all my money out last month.",-1
"Ok, but that's beside the point anyway.

The point is that Robinhood is still a rather amateurish platform. Not arguing with cheapest, but what else do they have going for them? Intuitive UI? Sure, credit goes where credit's due. But what else? The list of pros ends about there. The UI is intuitive but basic. Everything else about RH is also basic. There's bare-bones news aggregation about stocks, for example; only some stocks have any of that info. They don't even support all the stocks/funds that are out there. One example: PDI; I love PDI. It's one of my bigger positions now for the high dividends. And there's not as much customization as could be done with TDA--how you could toggle on/off columns and rearrange the order. Customer support was infuriating last time I tried it.",1
"I would advise against stock picking in general, but especially so as a beginner. I'd advise going instead for ETFs that give you broad exposure to the market as a whole so you're betting on its growth rather than the volatility of a single stock.

r/bogleheads gives decent advice on this strategy. Vanguard total index is a pretty safe bet (VWRP)

Also: be very wary of meme stocks (GME, AMC etc): their subreddits are just echo chambers that propagate misinformation. Ever single time someone asks for advice as a newbie these guys come out of the Woodworks to try to lure them in. If you're coming from the crypto world, they're just like the stans of shitcoins but more deluded.",0
"my advice to you, 

options can be a great way to make money, they are a fantastic way to lose money too.

they are also way more complex, with different rules than trading stock. 

If you are unsure what would happen if you hold a contract till expiration, I highly recommend you stay away from options,

Investopedia has a great options trading guide. read through it, twice, take extensive notes the second time, then read it again till you understand it.

once you have a better idea, start very slowly dipping your toe in the water.. 

trading options on ibkr is cheap.. play around, but have some basic understanding of what your getting yourself into.",0
"QQQM, QQQJ, ARKF, QTUM, BATT, HELX, URNM, MSOS, CNBS and I am sure tons more can't be traded on there.  The new ARKX coming out soon likely won't qualify either.  I've complained multiple times and so have others, but clearly they don't care.

Open a Fidelity Account and buy what Merrill blocks in there.  Hit $100K in Merrill and then just stop using it and switch fully to Fidelity (or your pick).  At least, that's what I've done.",1
"Schwab sucks, TD was so friendly being able to submit a trade at the bottom of the screen versus clicking through and filling out several fields",1

"I personally try to stay way from big exchanges like Binance etc

The one I use is a decentralised exchange called SOLOdex, it's run by a company called Sologenic (who have their own coin on the XRPL) and offers easy access to on/off ramps and purchasing of crypto via your card (using a company like BANXA etc)

It's pretty straightforward and can use multiple wallets (Leap, Keplr, Xaman, Ledger etc)",0

"I will watch them, maybe it clarifies it, because I still don't get it. The amount of money I have invested is 4 times as much as the initial margin amount displayed on IBKR for me. My buying power is the 4X that you mentioned.

  
Like, I understand the 2x-4x, thing, it's the maximum I can borrow intraday and overnight, but that is my buying power afaik, this number listed under initial margin, and initial maintenance margin is something completely different.",0
"Texas here too.  I use FISXX because, well I don’t remember why.  Anyway, it’s a fidelity fund, invests in essentially the same stuff as SPAXX.  As noted elsewhere you have to manually buy it and sell it, which is a distinct pain in the butt.  So if you need something like a checking account it’s not going to work, but if you want to shove money away for an upcoming expense, it works fine.

Also note that the yield is expressed as an annual figure, not monthly, and if short term rates go down, expect the yield on FISXX (and the rest of the money market universe) to also go down.",0

**Here's some terrible advice though**. Now might be a good time to try and play the market as you're not really in too deep and see if you want to sell and buy other stocks. You'll probably fail and lose more money, but you'll learn a valuable lesson, which is ""just let it be"".",0

"AVWAP - the new study that is built into TOS is a marginal improvement, but it still stinks.  Schwab (if you are listening!) needs to implement it as a DRAWING, so that it can be anchored at different points for different stocks.  The way it is done today, it will retain the same point in time when you look at different stock charts.  

The marginal improvement I mentioned is that if you right click on the chart now, you can change the anchor point.  Still doesn't solve your request for automatic anchoring, but it is small consolation compared to what used to exist before.",-1
"Payment for order flow. The broker gets paid by market makers to route trades to them. Almost all brokers do it. I know fidelity doesn't and ibkr doesn't for ibkr pro (they do for ibkr lite). This impacts your execution price on market orders. Fidelity has the best execution improvements based on reports. I also see this when I trade. Fidelity is #1. However etrade and schwab are decent compared to interactive brokers lite, webull, robinhood, and moomoo. These are all the brokers I've tried. If you only use limit orders, it shouldn't impact you. But at times I'm trading high volume so I use market and limit orders.",1
"I had no problem understand what they were asking....seems pretty clear to me. It looks like you're just spitting hairs for unknown reasons.

"This is free advice and not meant as negative to OP one way or another. It is incumbent on everyone using margin to read the TD Ameritrade Margin handbook cover to cover, and then reread it again.

Good luck to OP.",0
It is true for me and at least for one other person in comments. This is absolutely terrible glitch that may go very wrong for me ☹️,-1
"Probably from the other jokers who replied with basically spam. One suggested op should just dive in head first like a lemming. The other two just used the opportunity to ask op to DM them for a referral like that's a loophole around referral spam rules. All 3 want to keep in touch with op via private message or by redirecting them to another subreddit they're trying to get off the ground. Same ol', same ol'.

Having all your liquid assets tied to a single account is boneheaded when resolving issues can only be done by playing tag with a person via email, phone, or chat. I see people complaining about seemingly minor things that lead to their entire account being locked for weeks or longer. Passing crypto to/from wallets flagged as related to gambling will lock your entire account, entering the incorrect pin too many times at a POS has locked entire accounts, having a recurring bank transfer fail has locked entire accounts, *outgoing* transfers to closed bank accounts have locked entire accounts, people flagging their own account as insecure when they lose their debit card, people not updating their account when they renew their government ID, dummies losing access to the phone number tied to their account when they switch phone plans or services, people forgetting to copy MFA keys to a new device when they upgrade, people travelling abroad with the debit card location protection still on, people failing to cover a margin call, etc. That's just a sample of what I see fairly regularly. Heck, all you need is someone's email address and you could initiate an investigation that'll last days or weeks with a single message sent to report@robinhood.com telling them that it has been compromised.

Only a moron would have their entire financial life bound to Robinhood or Acorns or Webull or M1 or Public or whatever they think has the most fun and awesome app or gives them the best referrals. When a problem arises, having it handled by someone who only has your issue to deal with while you're sitting across from them cannot be overestimated.",0
"The mantra is don't use stop orders for options trading.  But if you're going to anyway, then you should probably have used a stop limit order, because the market order that results from a stop order isn't guaranteed to execute at the price that triggered the stop.  At least with a stop limit order, you lose guaranteed execution after the stop is triggered, but get a guaranteed price if it does execute.

On illiquid instruments like options, it's so easy to accidentally trigger a stop or get a horrible fill on a market order.  If there is only one party maintaining the order that dictates the current bid or ask, and they momentarily cancel their order, then if your market order hits during that moment, you'll get filled at the order at the next best price, which could be cents or dollars away from the cancelled order.",0
"They are commited to bring you to that 80% of people that lose money club. That's one of the reasons I love making money off them. I also noticed the index disapearing because I was riding the ups and downs. 

Also, when stocks are volatile but on the way up they set quantity limits that are not stated anywhere. Happened yesterday with APHA and has happened with PLTR, FEYE and SPCE to me in the past. It gives you a message saying something like you cannot buy because if you did it would exceed the max ammount permited. Ok, fair, so you test to see if you can buy the MINIMUM amount and sometimes it doesn't allow the purchase. When I asked the costumer support about this they said, and I quote ""... you should pick another stock.""


Sadly I don't think you can translate your positions directly. You'll have to do it ""analogically"" by withdrawing the funds and applying them elsewhere with fresh and, I guess, worse positions as you will not inherit the entry of the others.

Beware though, make sure etoro isn't just the same but with a better marketing pitch.",0

"TOS is written in java and is largely single threaded...  on paper the fastest single core CPU is going to give you the best bang for the buck.

"Besides the other good advice there are legal clinics in Singapore that can give you legal advice for free.

I would suggest you prepare documents that supports facts as best you can.

* Medical documentation for dementia
* The ILP

* The relevant dates of interacting with the agent etc.

Lawyers love bullet points they can digest, together with supporting documentation.

It’s possible you have other avenues to pursue against the agent that a lawyer can help you with, and getting a law firms letter on a complaint is taken a lot more serious than a customer complaint.

"I think you need one to get preferred rewards, but you don’t need to use it. It’s a good idea to have more than one checking account in case one has a problem. There are horror stories of banks suddenly choosing to freeze accounts with no understandable reason. Maybe they have KYC quotas, though that seems unlikely.

Fidelity CMA is a good option. You can invest the funds in FDLXX. The yield is a little less than TTTXX, but you can withdraw money without having to sell first, and they will credit ATM fees anywhere.

Fidelity is actually an example of the reason to have multiple accounts. They don’t have traditional retail banking locations for depositting cash, and a few months ago they stopped accepting mobile check deposits of more than $1000 for many customers because they were experiencing meme-level deposit fraud.

In such a case you could deposit money and checks to your ~0% interest Bank of America checking account, electronically transfer some to Merrill TTTXX paying 4.4%, and some to Fidelity FDLXX paying 4.2%. The advantage would still remain with the funds held at Fidelity always being available to withdraw as cash or to use to pay bills and write checks.",0
"As of November 14, Nvidia's stock has risen +196.44% this year, making it the most valuable company globally with a market cap of $3.6 trillion. On November 20, after hours EST, this AI chip giant company is set to release its Q3 FY2025 financial results. Looking ahead to the third quarter, the market generally expects Nvidia to achieve revenues of $33.028 billion, an 82.27% increase YOY; earnings per share are anticipated to be $0.7, up 88.11% YOY. This also means that the company is expected to achieve record-breaking revenue and profits for the sixth consecutive quarter. However, just before the earnings release, this Sunday The Information reported that Nvidia's new Blackwell AI chip is facing delivery delays due to overheating issues with its accompanying servers. ""Nvidia is working with leading cloud service providers as an integral part of our engineering team and process. The engineering iterations are normal and expected,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters. But anyway, this upcoming Q3 earnings release, being the first since joining the Dow, is bound to create significant ripples in the global financial field and will be a bellwether for global stock markets.

Amidst the surge of major tech companies increasing their investments in AI, how do you foresee Nvidia benefiting? Do you think the hiccup with the Blackwell AI chip will have a significant impact?We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Thanks for using Moomoo. 🐮

In general, you are eligible for a dividend if you purchase a stock before the ex-date and the dividend should hit your account the day after the payable date.   You need to have DRIP turned on to reinvest the dividends.  From your post, it looks like you are all set.

5. ""2k"" # 5% pa



FYI: IBKR generally doesn't pay interest on the full deposit balance, nor the full rate on accounts less than a value threshold (nor on short stock proceeds, futures balances, etc), hence the quotes above.  So for #1, if the effective interest rate is 5% pa, I'd expect the interest calculation to be more like $90k x 5% pa, and for #5, $0 x 5% pa.",0

ive been dealing with this for over 2 months.

The time zone that you’re in is terrible if you plan on actively trading each day during market hours.  it’s manageable for swing trades which I believe is what your looking to do anyway. My advice would be to stay away from options. If you insist and you must trade them then my advice would be to stick to small size trades. The problem with options is that people want to go all in and risk their whole portfolio on a single trade and the time that it doesn’t work out then your back to square one with building your account again. But to your question as to should you sell the position that your in that is up 877% I would say yes sell it. I think you got about all that you’re going to get from that trade.

">While I get that people don't like the normal Schwab tools if they are trying to insert certain types of advanced orders and get real-time quotes, what I don't get is why none of them seem interested in moving up to ToS which is the correct tool for that type of trading.

Agreed. TOS is the obvious choice, but I think there are some people who were doing this on TDA's site, which is pretty decent for a trading website. I know a guy who uses TDA site for options trading because he's trading from work and can't install TOS on his work PC. So for that small % of users, switching from TDA site to Schwab site for trading will be crippling. Sounds like not much will change for TOS users in terms of our usage of, and trading on, TOS.",0
"I'm really happy with Fidelity so far!  I use my CMA like a savings account – not a checking account (Chase) – and it's great, no problems at all.  Once I hit a certain amount, it automatically transfers to my brokerage account; it's totally set and forget. I've never tried using it for checking because it doesn't have Zelle, but I highly recommend Fidelity's CMA for managing extra cash.",0
"ToS was started just about when the finance industry standardized on Java (which benefitted of $1B in marketing from Sun and rode a huge wave of hype as ""the language of the Internet""). Those days were nuts. I remember a non-technical program manager walked to me one day in 1998 and asked, ""We really need to get into this Java thing!"" whilst obviously didn't know what even the thing was.

Client apps in Java will inevitably be slow and bloated, and ToS is no exception (so were/are the older platforms from Schwab, Merrill, IBKR, TastyTrade). It's hurt many a trader, but it's a historical accident we're still paying for. (There was an exception called Medved QuoteTracker that was written in Pascal and really spritey. It connected to Ameritrade.)

I don't see the situation getting a lot better in the foreseeable future.",0

"Oh ok. Because I know with my Schwab account, they don't start charging interest until after a day or 2",0

Is this confirmed? Awesome if so. I haven’t had any issues worth it on my phone vs the fidelity app which constantly glitches. Also would hate to see the free cnbc steaming go away.,0
"I agree, lots of customization in TOS, just have to dig a bit. My wish list for TOS so far:
- I want to see Markets dashboard as pts and not only %
- I want Markets dashboard futures to show pre and post market. Not just market open and close (it’s there just have to expand carrot icon which creates more noise)
- make sure market value is shown in My Positions automatically. Finally found the customization “net liquidity” which is same thing.
- when in a chart, show some obvious shading between market open and close, not just timestamps at bottom

Basically TD Ameritrade got a lot right on the phone UI/experience. What to include, what to omit, how to cram info in tiny spaces, how to see more in one glance instead of side scrolling.
Please look at that experience and bring more of it to Schwab native app. I’d leave TOS alone at this point. It’s bloated, but people like all the widgets and customization.",0

"No, they are eliminating the StreetSmart Edge platform and pushing everyone into ToS. I'm in the minority, but I've been using StreetSmart Central (the web platform) for years and I am too used to it and love it. I am really pissed they are going strictly ToS because while the downloadable platforms (StreetSmart Edge and ToS) are fairly similar, the ToS web based platform is nowhere near as good as StreetSmart Central. The StreetSmart Edge phone app is crappy, but I found it easiest to use for trading futures.",0
"I'll have to see for myself. I have my Roth in Fidelity and even though it's still not TDA, I have grown accustomed to it. I'll see how much I like it when I eventually transfer and if I don't, I can always transfer to Fidelity. With the amount I make, most of my investing is man be in my Roth IRA now instead of my TDA taxable anyway. TDA does hold a special place in my heart because it's where I learned everything I know today and I love its format. Hoping if I'm patient, Schwab will be more like TDA.",0

I would appreciate any recommendations you can provide for me. I open ToS as admin and set the priority in task manager to High and clear cache each morning. ToS also has access to all 32gb of ram.

I like Schwab also.   Since 2017.,1
"Yes-ish. It consciously recognizes that there a subset of really irresponsible spenders in the US economy that is low income and debt ridden, and then misleads them with all sorts of drip pricing, tips, service fees, and buy now pay later loans on door dash (grab food order) to milk them dry because the American government does not pass any legislation to misrepresent false advertising.

America is home to the extremes: incredibly rich people, and then illiterate and irresponsible spenders. Hard to cancel trials, tips and in transparent pricing, etc. It's very hard to ascertain the true price of certain services and goods, and I think that is largely by design.

A good example of this is cruise ship pricing and Airbnb prices in the US vs the rest of the world. These two companies both design websites specifically for the US that hide tax and tips and cleaning fees from the sticker price in the US, but show them fully baked in (this being more expensive) in a country like Australia if you viewed the exact same cruise.",0

"Ach is essentially a promise that you have money in the account.  A clearing house handles the cash as a middle man and takes as much as 3 days before Schwab sees the money.

"Here’s my take, based on what I’ve seen since 1997.

Over the years, I’ve witnessed market cycles—both in equities and real estate. Many of my clients and close friends, now in their 50s to 80s, fully own properties they purchased decades ago. Despite all the ups and downs, their daily lives remain unaffected by market noise. At their age, most of the properties they have invested in are already fully paid up, with no leverage. In fact, some are still actively investing, buying overseas properties when currencies like the yen are low or picking up holiday homes in places like Bangkok.

**Why?** Because owning a hard asset, especially one bought at the right price, offers peace of mind—not sleepless nights.

Here are a few thoughts to consider:

1. **If you're buying a home to live in**, you're either going to pay rent or pay a mortgage. If the numbers make sense and you're not overpaying or over-leveraging, it’s a solid move. There are still fairly priced freehold condos in the East asking between $1,4xx to $1,8xx psf. Even some leasehold units are asking around $1,1xx to $1,4xx psf. It is difficult to put a price on something, especially your home, as long as you are not paying an exorbitant amount, in my opinion. Just be wary of new launches asking high prices—projects in Lentor at $2,6xx psf or Jurong East at $2,3xx psf, for example, may not offer the same value right now.
2. Yes, I will personally I will pay more down payment. I don't like to overgear. channeling some of it into property isn’t a bad idea—especially with current interest rates around 2.6%+. If rates go down in the future, you have the option to refinance (take out some cash). Meanwhile, your money is parked in a tangible asset. Time passes very fast. You might even fully pay off the apartment in 10-15 years.

Ultimately, no one can time the market perfectly. But smart, long-term decisions made with prudence tend to reward people over time.",0
"It is so terrible that I just park my ETF there. Even if I want to trade, I dont. Lol",-1
"Did you do this? 

I was informed that under forms and applications, if you enter ""ira to roth"" you can use the second form to do this online.  I would take some number of days to clear.  I did also use the phone method this year (waited 15-25 mins then maybe 10 mins on the phone when someone was available). The person on the line said I could do in the future to E-sign and avoid the phone call.  Has anyone done this?

"The mobile app is really really really bad. Some customers atest the website is better, but if you're not that type of customer then prepare for disappointment.

The Schwab app is difficult to navigate though. The fact that Schwab does not give transitioned customers the opportunoty to try their app beforehand is criminal.

The share prices are all different on each page, they're not in sync with each other. Monitoring and research has to be conducted using a third party app/site.

To buy/sell is not intuitive at first. Later you'll feel how cumbersome the process is after dealing with TD Ameritrade.

Their customer service is decent.",-1
"Yeah that’s a fair point. I do find everyone being a little dramatic right now though. That’s not to dismiss what you’re saying since I personally invest the money but it’s split between about 50% US market etfs, 20% tech etfs, 10% (Chinese) and then the remaining 30% in etfs of other countries like India and the UK, it’s just a statement saying people are being overly dramatic right now.",0

"There has to be something specific about you or your setup. That’s all I have to say. Think about it closely, and without prejudice that you ought to be able to use the platform. No point in posting here to be honest. As you can tell, nobody can answer your query. You’d have to start disclosing personal details and that’s not something to do online, and even then, IBKR must have their own reasons for why they flagged your account.",0
"With respect, if you are a daily active trader with TDA, why aren't you using **thinkorswim**? Your experience will then be largely unchanged after the transition.

My accounts are futures enabled, so I am also slated to migrate over on May 10, 2024. There are pros/cons to both websites, though yes, I agree, TDA is much better. (But there ARE things that CS does that are better implemented, at least for me).

But since I spend most of my time in **thinkorswim** anyway, my experience (hopefully!) will be smooth.

I do have accounts at **Tradestation**, **Tradovate**, **Tastytrade**, **Webull**, **Robinhood**, **IBKR**, **Fidelity**, and **Vanguard**. **Tradingview** integrates will some of them, and for fee and no fee, depending on the brokerage. I am currently testing out **NinjaTrader**. (Yes, I'm a broker junkie!)

If you are actively trading ***stocks*** on a web interface, then **Webull**, **IBKR**, or **Fidelity** might work well for you. If ***options***, then try out **Tastytrade**, probably the best UX/UI for options (the founder is the same guy who created thinkorswim). 

And try out **Tradingview** for UX/UI experience (they are not a brokerage, just a front-end for brokerages).

Good luck!",0
"Yeah at first it looks that way. The other day someone was complaining about their account being locked and they “did nothing wrong” turns out they were attempting to pull funds via ACH from a bank account belonging to someone else. 

Another case someone was attempting to scan starter checks.

"I've tried moomoo, and for now, it's working really well for me. Moomoo provides free real-time options chains and free secondary market data, which Schwab doesn't offer. Most importantly, the interface is user friendly, unlike Schwab, which can be quite confusing.",-1
"Terms & Conditions.  I have read them actually.  I am aware.  Even the coupons you get for discounted shares.  I can’t quote it now, and don’t care enough, but when I read it, I chose to not exercise points for “coupons”.

From what I gathered he had unclaimed free shares yet to be awarded.

No sense in the additional quoted days after more days after more days only to find a reason.  It’s odd that you can’t accept the full context of the story.  If that was a reason, they should have never made him rely upon each next ETA.  Rely upon means planning and promising money to be used for something personal to the client, like the guy posting here that he could not pay his bills relying upon MooMoo’s ETA promises.

Do you work for Moomoo?  You responded to every single issue, and then some, except for that.",0
Most likely this might be due to some problem on the TD side. I had a similar problem when moving assets from ETrade. Could be due to some account restriction or some other weird bs.,0
"I moved away from IBKR because I wanted FHSA (which they do now offer but did not before) and because I wanted the HBP for my RRSP in near future. IBKR do not offer the latter.

Otherwise I would have stuck with them. I dont see a lot of difference between them both for my needs, which is buying ETFs or Cash.to. I know WS is free compared to IBKR but IBKR charges pennies for each trade so it was pretty much free. Gave me access to US market too, which was fun for a while but then i doubled down to only buying ETFs.",1
I don’t even look at the stock price in Freetrade. Check real time price on third party platforms then sell or buy on Freetrade. Never failed me once. I love Freetrade.,1
"If the account owner was simply making investment purchases of stocks then there wouldn't be any debt or money owed.  If I own 100 shares of Company X that I purchased at $50/share then I've invested $5000. If Company X's stock price drops to $0.00, I've lost my $5000 investment but I'm not in debt or have a negative balance, I simply own 100 shares worth $0.00 each.

However, if they were trading options or short selling, there could be some money owed on those contracts. But in that case if there's any debt owed I don't think it would transfer to the beneficiary, but would probably want to check with a lawyer on that. Worst case you would work with a financial advisor that would help you close out any outstanding option contracts and pay whatever fees are owed on those contracts from the owner's brokerage account. But I don't believe you would be out of pocket yourself for those since they are a contract and you did not sign the contract. Again, verify this with a lawyer if needed. 

Schwab has very excellent customer service, if you contact them they will be able to answer any of your questions.",1
"Definitely... I had my Roth IRA with them and ended up having a brokerage account with them too... Plus in the last year Fidelity has made tremendous progress on updating there user interface... If you go there you will definitely see the difference right away.

Other biggest benefit I like is the customer service is one of the best! Both on call(specific support) and via reddit (general support) they go out of there way to help and provide through information. 

To transfer just had to provide my account number of Charles and had to tell them what kind of account it is (personal brokerage, IRA, Roth, etc) and they are taking care of the transfer. 

Crazy thing is no one reached out from Charles, not one email but I know they got the request as they have stopped me from doing any trading. 

For reference I have used Webull, td Ameritrade, Charles, vanguard and Fidelity so my opinion of liking Fidelity is in comparison to this apps, obviously my #1 preference was Td Ameritrade.

Good luck.

"Same here, I don't see why they decided to close it down instead of just keeping it operating as another platform under the Schwab Umbrella. They wanted to incorperate parts of TDA into Schwab, But they clearly ... haven't? I mean the feel is very different, and most aspects of the platform look and feel and work very differently than they did at TDA. I took my money out into savings right before the transition and haven't yet put it back, I just have a dividend account and small roth. Haven't made more than 2 or 3 individual trades so far so I can't speak to the trading, But the only real Advantage I've found so far is the Gain/Loss for individual stocks, I like how it shows the cost basis and overall , and how many of each share were bought when for each price. The themes is kinda neat and useful for research ideas. Functionally everything else seems pretty much the same -- As you'd expect of any brokerage. Is that worth being booted from TDA? Absolutely not in my opinion. I would go back to TDA if given the option.",0
"Sounds like it is in the process of going through and just has not updated. If you are worried about it, by all means call your bank. There is a lot of shenanigans going around with regard to electronic transfers these days so you cannot be too careful. I guess I would be more worried if it no longer showed at your bank and has not appeared at the broker.",0
"Absolutely correct.   
I experienced the same thing. Moreover, the price would fluctuate radically on Feb 10, 2021.   
I called it in and as expected several other customer had done the same account to rep Francesco Biasi. He kindly offered to clear a complaint and suggested that by morning all would be in order, as it did. However, this is an indication there are serious flaws with Merrill Edge (Bank of America) trading infrastructure and , more importantly, the fact that Merrill Edge allows folks to buy SNDL but yet imposes some weird fee after the fact and manipulates the price. If the stock is blocked, then so be it. But don't change the rules of the game at half time.   


This entire fiasco has caused me to re-evaluate using Merril Edge (Bank of America).",1
"Knowing that TDA was going to be extinct, I opened a small Schaub acct last year to get a feel of the interface and stuff and also one at Fidelity for the same reason.  I like the TDA web and mobile interface over both Fidelity and Schwab.  Between Fidelity and Schwab, I like Fidelity.  I'm not a big fan the Schwab interface.

Going to move all my stuff over to Fidelity and have everything under one roof at Fidelity.  I think, for me, it's the better option than having everything at Schwab. 

One thing that might be a hang-up is one of my kids UTMA accounts.  Son just turned 18 so I can't do an online transfer into a Fidelity UTMA on line.  In my state (MA) the kids don't get full control of their UTMA accounts until age of 21.  I don't know why they won't allow me to transfer the UTMA account from TDA to Fidelity.    Probably an easy wrinkle to work out but will probably have to do it via a phone discussion with Fidelity.

I'm going to miss some of the research tools that TDA provided like portfolio Xray they have with Morning Star, ETF comparisons, etc. but gotta roll with the changes.

Supposedly it takes about 3 to 5 business days to get the accounts and funds transferred from TDA to Fidelity.",0

"There is a reason why we have governments. Take Econ101 or read the paper The Economic Origins of Government” by Robert C. Allen. Yes we have public goods because of a government.

Systems like irrigation, roads, or public sanitation require massive coordination, long-term planning, and continuous maintenance.

My house was bought pre Covid thanks to this. I liquidated my down payment and did terrible math. Instead of 20% did 35%. I was doing some back of napkin calculations and figured 35% down will give me slightly favourable monthly mortgage payments but then down the line decided against it. But totally forgot which calculation was which and liquidated the 35. This was 2 months before the crash and at the peak. Shear luck.

Well Cramer is an idiot and schwab isn’t going anywhere they are a strong reputable company that’s been around for decades.

Since you're already invested in S&P500, it would make more sense to buy an ex-US global fund and an emerging markets fund instead of the all-world and set the balance you want separately - or you can take the balance by looking at the regional distribution of the all-world you would've chosen.

"None of the fixed fee brokers are as bare bones as Freetrade though. When you compare them to the competition, they just look bad in every aspect. Then you have T212 giving you a free ISA +1% cash back and an FX fee of 0.15% (Freetrade free account is 0.95%), faster stock price updates, after hours prices, more stocks/ETFs, faster bank withdrawals and that’s just a few. I don’t care what others do with their money but the competition just makes Freetrade look bad. Then the fact you have to delete the account if you decide to change platforms just seems like a bit of a scam. I’d understand if they didn’t let you buy without the monthly fee but they require you to close the account. Not great when the point of an ISA is to have it compound over time.",0
"That makes sense, but other brokers I’ve used still don’t allow you to make the second transaction until after the first one has settled. Maybe they were ones just being extra conservative.",0

"- 1). Buying penny stock

I predict you will lose a lot of money…

I suggest you educate yourself before you go getting wrapped up in scams and making a bunch of mistakes. Go slow, there’s no rush. Also, the market is ridiculously unstable because “there’s a horse in the hospital” (John Mulaney), so normal market trends and mechanics won’t always work as usual.

GL.",0
"Looks cool but you might want to consider a profession platform over TOS. You're obviously invested in trading and hardware so maybe trade with a broker that doesn't get paid for orderflow, actually has some risk management capabilities and brokers who have actually traded a share of stock or options. Hell, use Robinhood for the same Citadel fills, get better margin rates and free options trading.",-1
"It seems natural to only make some of these features available to Plus members, who will likely get more use out of them. And it's a way to add some real tangible value to the proposition.",0
"I talked with customer care this morning. Just in general, Charles Schwab is backlogged to hell. After everything that happened with Robinhood, folks started looking for new brokers. I’d just give it time. I’ve been waiting on a checking account for 6 days and was given similar advice a few days ago. It’ll all work out when they catch up.",-1
"It's not weird in the slightest, more assets doesn't mean more gains or diversification. Once you start adding more ETF's you'll start to get overlap.

You could add a bond fund/ETF like global aggregate bonds, that would make a very ideal 3 fund portfolio. 

The 3 fund portfolio was strongly advocated by the founder of the Vanguard group.",0
Just because you don't understand the bid-ask spread doesn't mean Freetrade are using bad trading practices,0
on the mobile/desktop app. it was there one day then not there the next. it just says unavailable currently. who knows maybe i broke ULA but pretty sure i didn't.  either way I'm looking for an answer from u/webull why disable comments?,0
"Customer service is AWFUL! As someone who manages a busy business and handles customer service, ibkr is just atrocious. Notifications and bulletins don't properly display, and then I can't reach a rep by phone. I have to hold for an HOUR, and then when the rep got on the line, he put me on hold again for over an hour. It was so long that their customer service closed and I was unable to do the transfer. So I used another brokerage but unfortunately lost money from the missed opportunity.

With a normal broker, you can transfer funds in 30 min. But ibkr takes minimum 3 business days. They tell you to wire it, but it's the 21st century - no bank does wires anymore bc you can e transfer! But ibkr can't handle etransfers in a timely manner.

I think you get what you pay for. I'm closing my account. My time is worth more than the ""savings"" from fees from ibkr.",-1
There no such thing as a US self directed LIRA. The self directed LIRA account does support having a USD account opened within it just like RRSP and TFSA but even if you don’t subscribe to USD accounts a CAD LIRA can still hold US listed ETFs and stocks. It just can’t hold USD cash. If you subscribe to USD accounts it works fine for holding USD in the LIRA,0
"Go for an ECN trader, not a market maker broker like Etoro. Market makers work against you and are incentivized to cause your losses at their profit.

"Honestly this is the best year to start investing. Having a market crash is the best time to invest. Don't look at the monetary value of your investment, look at the number of shares you have. Treat this as a consolidation phase and accumulate as much as possible. I DCA every week the same amount regardless of it being green or red idgaf. Just remove emotion and you'll do just fine.

"Regulations in Latin American countries to fight money laundering. Panama is black listed by eToro and in Costa Rica no bank will receive any funds from eToro. BAC and BCR (Banco Costa Rica), first bank being private and the latter being state owned. Add to the list all cooperatives, Davivienda and Mutual and not any of them will accept funds sent from eToro. This is getting really frustrating.",1
"I reckon there’s two things

1) you need some good capital to even get a shot at participating on the bids, so they want a solid base regularly signed up for them to stump up the half mil minimum every week (though they can probably fund that from their own assets)

2) they’ll start charging a % fee on the Treasury interest in 2-3 months or so. It gives some growth and upscale added to the MRR if they make it a compelling product returning at > money market & retail savings accounts.

It’s also a bit of a USP and maybe mission defining to make these instruments available to retail customers and ngl even if I wasn’t the target for it, I’m still there for any competition to democratise the market and make it accessible.",0

Vanguard 207 TDF sounds good,0
No I don’t keep things like that. Clearly in the future I should. Pretty much all I can find as proof of an account is emails from them with trading stuff and bank transactions with bi weekly transfers. The links in the emails go to an error page though and the account number is blocked out except for the last 4 digits ,0
"We also keep checking and money market accounts at our local credit union. I have seen posts of people trying to deposit large third party checks directly into Fidelity and the account being frozen. We almost always deposit checks like that in our credit union account and once it clears, we transfer the cash from the CU to Fidelity. We also can withdraw money from Fidelity and send directly to the credit union. I personally think it’s safer. We do use the Fidelity credit card for the 2% cash back.",1

"It's good most of the time. They have the phone lines staffed 24/7 and it never takes long for a rep to pick up. They also seem to be American based if that matters to you.

However, a few months ago I had a routine issue that ended up turning into a huge ordeal mostly due to the phone reps not being familiar with how it worked. This dragged on for a month and throughout the process I had many phone calls with different reps and I often got contradictory instructions and advice. I couldn't directly talk to the department that was working on my issue and the phone reps only seemed to communicate with them through notes. There was a lot of miscommunication and it cost me money.

I wouldn't let this discourage you though as the phone reps are nice people who try their best. The CS beats most places, especially nowadays. Just don't try to remove an excess contribution from a Roth IRA at TD Ameritrade lol.",1
"1. What are your goals? Daytrading, swing or long term
2. What kind of investor or trader are you? Individual stocks, ETF, forex, etc
3. How conservative or aggressive are you?

I will post here in a few days (don’t have my computer with ToS on me), my standard technicals ‘build’ for you to import… it’ll have a combination of MA, Stochastics, and Bollinger bands. 

I have found that newer traders do well once they understand these and some basic technical analysis and a *strong* knowledge of candlesticks. 

These are the basics. 

Definitely use the Paper Money option to learn & test before using real funds. 

Get good at making a profit, no matter how small and be consistent and have only minimal loses. 

This is how every trader should start.",0

"I was told by my accountant that they received some kind of notice that there was a problem getting data into the CRA website. It was explained that this had to do with some change to the system that was implemented at the end of last year and was causing problems. (Didn’t get any more of an explanation, but this is consistent with the claim that it is some form of validation causing the issue.)

Bit of a mess. Checked my own page and it had no T3s, missing multiple T5s and one of two RRSP slips. Relevant to this sub-Reddit, nothing from Wealthsimple is there. (Although, I have managed to collect all the relevant slips.)",0
"Yeah, I heard about this from a rep I asked and my feeling is F ML and I’m slowly moving over to Fidelity with SPAXX as core. I’ll leave $100K+ in NVidia and Apple so I get preferred banking, but my normal trading is switching.  They shouldn’t make it this hard when others are making it so easy. Also, they don’t trade JEPQ, estate accounts don’t work right and they’ve f’d up too many times for me.",0

"I have a Fidelity account as well as TDA and Fidelity is easy to use with good support if needed.

My only compliant is that the rich graphical interface that makes it easy to use is slow.  They do have Active Trader Pro which is also very nice, but again the rich graphics slow it down compared to TOS.

"Research SpreadBetting first of all.  But if you really want to trade CFD's, I would suggest you use IBKR.  The spreads can be brutal on T212, and they move the spreads as well (typically not in your favour!!  Furthermore, T212 charges overnight fees on things like Futures, which other brokers don't.  Be careful as you go forward and think about what I have said here.   You can lose money RAPIDLY with leverage, and playing with a paper account on a video-game style app like T212, is dangerous in real-life, with real money.  Best of luck!",-1

"Even sadder to even think TT is Java. I also agree with you—  I would only agree to a full on rewrite if they keep all features as is currently available and just update the foundation, which should be possible.

"Question is when you are sick do you want to have the choice? My mom shield plan covered her up to private patient at restructured hosp. But considering future follow ups post hospitalisation which cannot be claimed, she went the subsidised route but she cannot sleep well post surgery in subsidised wards. So we decided to upgrade her to private in RH. She has had 3 surgeries with 3 different doctors in restructured hospital so far and I think the doctors are good 

My plan covers me for private hosp so I have the option to see well-known specialist if I want to. Waiting time is also shorter for consultations, tests etc 

And If you have a major illness do you want to have the choice to choose the doctor performing the surgery on you? If cost is a concern you can downgrade your plan as you get older.",0

"Yeah I guess it is thanks for spotting that, but really I sent that from my phone and gave the wrong link, the one I was looking at on my laptop really is ES

And I guess SPX is almost never above ES anyway so it was definitely ES

But thank you for catching that, I need to add the right bookmark on my phone so I don’t look at the wrong info thinking it’s futures

Edit: oh I see what’s going on here, the link says futures but there’s like a toggle where it says “real time derived” where one says real time and one says delayed huh

Is this SPX, I’m so confused now idek what I’m looking at. Whatever I guess doesn’t matter. I guess I just need to get real time data from my broker

Edit 2: I think I was actually looking at the june contract which I just realized is not the front month contract, and the original link must be the front month contract, I don’t think it is spx man, I think it is ES but it’s good you got me to look at this closer and understand wtf I’m looking at and where my bookmarks are linking.

"Let's be real here, ME pales in comparison to the giants like Schwab, Fidelity, and Vanguard. Their offerings and customer service just don't measure up. The only reason I'm still here? Those credit rewards. Without them, I'd have jumped ship ages ago. Here's hoping they step up their game soon.",-1
"Could be margins, but they are not that big. You'd need to check with etoro, my guess is you may have confised the rate which is different from the amount in TP. I've seen issues like that with leverage",0
"In addition to the Preferred Deposit mentioned, the BIG benefit of Preferred Rewards is the 75% credit card bonus. Combine that with the Premium Rewards card and you’ll get 2.62% cash back on all purchases and 3.5% on travel and dining (a very liberally defined category). It’s pretty hard to beat that across the board. 

Note, usually Preferred Rewards takes 3 months to get, but since it sounds like you don’t have a checking account with them yet, if you open one and have $100K in Merrill, you should get it in a few days. The first 30 days of your first checking account is treated special.

And yes, their savings is shit. Preferred Deposit is pretty solid, but slightly annoying to manage, especially on mobile. Worth the APR though. Details: https://www.ml.com/solutions/preferred-deposit.html",1

"1. You can start investing with any amount of money. You can add more money into the same investment, or add money to the account and put it towards a different investment.

2. FXAIX is a mutual fund. So you can invest $50 into that fund. With mutual funds, you typically invest a dollar amount. The value of the fund changes each days. Currently it’s roughly $208/share. So a $50 investment on Monday would get you roughly 0.25 shares.  Every time you invest an additional $50, you’d get a different number of shares depending on the current price/share. So you may get 0.25 shares, or 0.27 shares, or 0.15 shares.  But as you continue to invest, you’ll acquire more and more shares.

3. Limit orders are more advanced and not something you need to be concerned with at first.  With mutual funds you typical don’t really use limit orders anyway. 

So for you I’d find one or two mutual funds that you think are good, long-term investments and start putting your money into those.

Remember, investments can go down too, so only invest what you’re willing to lose. That’s rule #1.

Also Fidelity has a TON of resources on investing and trading. From basics to advanced info. Check out the Learning Center (you can search for it in the Fidelity) search bar.",1
"My experience with Schwab's fraud department has been perfectly positive. In my experience they'll freeze the funds, do their research and in a couple days will contact you with whatever else is necessary. 

It may or may not be a PITA, but if this as in fact fraud you'll eventually be made whole.",1
"It’s most likely a BIN attack. Essentially, they guess your card details using brute-force computing. Try Googling and you’ll know more about it.
This happened to me once with my Curve card. And I never used that card anywhere online. I always used only Apple pay and to physical store. Once I reached to the customer service, they said it happens sometimes. I was refunded by the bank, so Trading212 should be able to revert the transaction or give a refund.",0
"There's about a million paths you can go down in webull. Do you want to invest your money into something for a long period of time? Or do you want to do trading which is buying stuff low (stocks, etfs, options, and futures) an selling it high. There's probably more than those 4 also but those are most popular from what I know. Its gonna be hard to be profitable trading if you don't do a lot of research an learn how it all works. Webull has paper trading also which is trading with fake money on the real market so you can practice. You need a subscription to live market data for that. This is a simplification of it all so learn as much as possible from books an the internet for the best chance at being profitable.",0

"The solution is pretty simple: don't use Trading212/eTorro.

Use  a real share-broker like IBKR, Vanguard, AJ Bell, Hargreaves Lansdown, etc. instead.

The one advantage CFDs have in the UK, not sure about other countries, is they're not subject to capital gains tax - for me that's never been a good enough reason to use them, and I don't touch platforms like Trading212 with a 10-foot pole.",-1

"Employers have to pay an annual fee for for retirement accounts and some may choose to close your accounts so that they don't have to pay the annual fee or they may just continue to pay it so that you can continue your retirement account there. You had the option to roll it over into an IRA at Fidelity which is what I did when I left my job.

I had a pension with another company and they sent me literature on a regular basis on how the pension fund was doing and on options if I wanted to cash out. It's your responsibility to keep track of your assets and consider whether or not your money is in the right place.

That said, it can be difficult to find these funds to move them to the right place as there's currently a lot of financial fraud going on and the institutions have to be careful with releasing information, verifying identity and transferring funds as they are on the hook if something goes wrong.",0
"Transferred my Roth ira for a sweet $5k+ bonus! Seriously thinking about my brokerage next.

"I am a Diamond club member that regularly takes out money. That should disclose the type of subjectivity that is involved in my opinion.

It is not a perfect platform, heck, nothing is. But it works well enough for me.

If the concern is about deeper information, I have multiple portfolios with multiple brokerage and none of them acts as a single stop for info source. I still have to do manual number crunching for fundamentals. It's just part of life.

If the concern is spread volatility, which implies that one is day trading, it's very difficult to do day trading on a web based portfolio. Day trading is about speed, you don't want to risk things just because the web lags for your trade and you enter/exit at the wrong price point.",0

"I opened a Schwab checking account online, initiated an ACH push transfer from my bank, but right after the funds were received 2 days later Schwab closed my new account without notice with no reason given. Getting my money back was a hellish experience. A year or so later I tried opening an account with Schwab again and yet again they gave me an account number, allowed me to login, but then closed it without notice and for no explicable reason a couple days later.

All of these brokerages and financial institutions have their issues. Luckily, I've always been aware of the delays with pulling funds so I've never had any problems with Fidelity. I always initiate transfers from the sending side. I'd personally recommend staying away from Schwab.",1

"The investment portfolio shows significant losses across various holdings, with the total value amounting to £1,825.09. While diversification is apparent, some stocks—like Riot Platforms, Hive Digital Technologies, and Snap—face notable declines. It's essential to consider adjusting the portfolio to focus on investments with stable growth potential or to reevaluate the strategy for higher-risk assets. Continuous monitoring and market research could help mitigate losses and guide future decisions effectively.",0
"Also, in addition to the highest rate, make sure you understand:

1.  What is a government money market fund

2.  What a liquidity gate is

3.  What a redemption fee is

These may or may not matter to you.  For me, as an example, my personal investment policy statement (IPS) prohibits me from investing cash for short-term liquidity needs (1 year or less) in any money market fund that may impose a gate or fee.  So this means no Prime funds.

Remember, the times you may need to use an emergency fund may also be bad times, both micro (loss of job) and macro (economic meltdown), so when you need to the money you want to make sure the fund cannot impose any restrictions by agreement.

Just my two cents on risk management (sort of Swiss Cheese theory).",0

You can get the details needed to send a wire to your Fidelity account somewhere within the transfers section.",0
"Has anyone tested the following? I have no intention to pull from Fidelity currently so the impact is zero. If I had too, ill put it on their CC and pay it off after, take the 2% into my brokerage on them.

Deposit, throw it all into a fund, I dont care what you choose, stable if you will outside the money market or whatever. Let the funds settle that way. Sell the shares, let it settle again, then wire it out? Kind of a bullshit approach but I wonder if that would kill the hold.",0
">Also I would get margin calls

I am not sure I understand how you were trading options, but I do not want a margin account.  I am strictly a cash account player.  I do not want to write options, at all.  I do not even want to write covered options (because I have no interest in owning or selling the under-lying stock).  My strategy is very simple (and of course does not work more than half the time).... if the chart pattern indicates SPY will decline, I want to buy a put, if the chart pattern indicates SPY will rise, I want to buy a call.  I use Bracket orders (on Fidelity, they are called OTOCO orders.... One Triggers OCO.... which in turn is a One Cancels the Other).  I set my stop loss as a Trailing Stop as tight as Fidelity will allow, and my limit for my profit target around 10 to 1 (profit/loss ratio) almost always the profit target is not achieved and I get closed out by the trailing stop.  During my paper trading on TD-A, I was able to achieve a consistent $100-$200 win rate per day.... limiting myself to just 1 option contract at a time.  On Fidelity I usually scale up to 5-10 contracts per transaction.

Besides losing delta efficiency near the end of day, my biggest problem is that my strategy causes me to miss some opportunities, due to my tight stop loss being triggered.  But overall, I find that keeping loses small is the key thing.  Sometimes I set the stop loss too tight and the transaction incurs a small lose (my own faulty judgement).  But when I can read the chart correctly and set a good stop loss.... well the rewards can be quite amazing.",0
"you saw venue where the trade executed (sounds like Nasdaq), went to their site, download all of the rules for maker/takers, and evaluated all of the rules, and determined the order qualified for a rebate, and determined that you did not receive the rebate?  IIRC, if you're on IBKR pro (I think with or without tiered pricing), you'll need all of that information to assess the correct fee in addition to whatever they post on their own public-facing website.  If you have checked all of the appropriate exchange rules (or even need confirmation of the conclusions that you and IBKR came to), that's when you'd bring this concern to IBKR.",0

"Honestly, I probably should have done that, My family does a lot of communications/socializing centered jobs, and I was just told that Webull was best all around, this was told by someone who is an actual professional Daytrader, I'm still going to do regular daytrading but I wanted to do Crypto as well since I do a lot of all-nighters anyways.",0
"Perhaps not this year, though I'd at least wait for the uptrend(?) to halt first. Review TSLA future plans then either sell soon while it's up a bit or plan to hold til say 2030 or so.

Tesla is ""overpriced"" due to what it plans to do on the future not what it does now. If you think those plans will fail or have very little chance of success it's best to sell now. Every few months TSLA tanks and every few months it's up again. Just depends on if the bull or bear narrative is stronger.

Don't invest on emotions or short term noise, and anything Elon does is definitely noise over the long term.",0
"This is a good idea but I wouldn’t tell them what to change. Send  a message that you’re unhappy with CS app and want the TDA app, if that’s not possible then why? Help me understand.

The company Broadcom symbol AVGO is listed by default under the B’s , Exon under the E’s instead of XOM, etc. etc. Well now we can sort by various ways but you have to set it EACH TIME YOU OPEN THE APP!

CASH.TO, from what I researched, uses the best high interest rates it can find.

"I can confirm that incoming deposits continued, but I can't say about debits because I was able to get everything switched over before payments were due. Well, one credit card issuer said the change wouldn't take effect until the next month, so I paid that from a Fidelity account.

One thing you might try is asking Schwab to issue you an account number and checking acct # in advance. If they won't, then open a Schwab account, fund it, and connect that to your auto-debits. When the rest of your TDA funds arrive, it will go into that account, or you can move your funds there. I was considering doing that as a last resort but ultimately everything worked out.",0
