Current Roth portfolio: 

BRK.B

O

I’d probably trim O and add more to CCI, as it’s been the better performer as of late. They both pay nice dividends. UNH I bought earlier last year and it did really well. I wish I sold after the CEO assassination but I don’t mind holding this one a little longer. I don’t think I want to add any new positions in my Roth.

META (might add a little)

MELI (might add a little)

VST (honestly not sure what to do here but holding atm)

LB (holding)

TMDX (holding)

Two separate pies, dividends set to drip into their respective pies at those allocations. Dcaing monthly, and will choose which one depending on the market situation. Slices can be moved into other pies, so it's pretty much just down to stock choices really, since ETF allocations are the same and the pies contribute to the same portfolio.

Nope. Just nope. You are balls deep in extremely overvalued US tech, to say nothing of the potential vulnerabilities of each individual company.

Also, with respect, I have no idea what you do for 1-2 hours per day if this is where you're at, though it's great that you're taking the time to do it properly, very few people do. 

At bare minimum move 25-30% into international, but realistically in this market 50-60% if you're working on a 5 year time horizon, you can adjust at that point. Right now the US market is valued more highly than the rest of the world combined. If someone offered you ownership of either every company on earth outside of the US or 80% of US companies, would you choose the 80% US? If not, then this should not be your portfolio. 

Also, is there a reason why you're choosing Sweden? It's not a bad play per se, but it's difficult to understand the reasoning of extreme heavy US tech + 15% Sweden + nothing."

Target is the middle and the middle is being eroded. Is the magnitude of the trade down sustainable? I don't know but I do think that the longer this trade down occurs and the more those people shop at WMT the more ingrained that becomes. How does Target compete against that? The primary thing is likely they have to compete on price, which is not great. Tariffs will be another issue. I would not be surprised if there is a new CEO sooner than later, but what can they really do?

So, I don't know. From my perspective, a problem I have with Target is that I look at the broader issues and I don't see it changing any time soon or easy answers to solve it.  That said, given what the stock has done and the situation as is at this point in time, how much of that is baked into the stock? It feels like the kind of thing where okay news could - at least temporarily - cause a nice rally. Any sort of improvement in the tariff situation could cause a rally. Of course, any material worsening of these situations (and if what's going on turns into more of a slowdown) could also cause further erosion.

""5k in SoFi""

I don't have anything against it really but I don't get the appeal. That said, I think the issue with JPM (and which will be more of an issue with something like SoFi) is that people view what's going on as a potential slowdown.

""all of them are down about 5%. So lost about 3k. It keeps going down. ""

It's a bummer that you're down but I think you have to look at it from the standpoint of given the market that we've had in a few weeks, a lot of people are down (I am, too) and how much are you down relative to your risk tolerance, goals, index, etc? The market has bad days, weeks, months and it's never fun by any means but it becomes if someone is very stressed by all this, then they have to make some changes in their portfolio (too much risk and/or too much money in the market.)  To me, this sort of situation where names are increasingly oversold, stuff down 20-30%+ in a month, sentiment horrible on a historic level is when you want to not be overly stressed by the market and instead look around and *gradually* start buying at least a bit of what everyone else is throwing out."

PYPL is in a lot of people's portfolios on here and still not really seeing the appeal: yes, it's cheap but it's cheap because it's a maturing story (TPV growth down over the last 6 quarters, etc.) If they can manage to reboot the growth story, that's something else but it's fintech: what can you really do that hasn't already been done and if there is something that you can do that hasn't already been done, there's nothing keeping a dozsen other players from doing their own version.

BYD has a foreign ordinary share class (although some brokers charge absurd fees for trading in foreign ordinaries - symbol ends in F) and an ADR in the US."

That is, you have 100% exposure to one country on earth and 0% to 194 others. You are 100% in a massively overvalued market and 0% in companies with competitive valuations. You are 100% in companies that are extremely vulnerable to geopolitical events and recessions and 0% in companies that fare well in that environment. You are 100% in established companies that may well be past their prime and 0% in new opportunities. 

The other person is right - there's no inherent reason to sell at a loss unless your thesis has changed. It's just that this should never have been your portfolio in the first place unless you have an insane level of confidence in US Tech. Also, it's highly questionable how you can possibly be optimistic about all of these companies or even know much about them - I'm willing to bet anything you don't have a strong understanding of most of them. 

I would do a few things:

1. Figure out which companies you actually understand and are confident in. 

2. Find two BM ETFs: one Europe, one Int'l, and at bare minimum stick 25% (but realistically more) into those even if you're utterly confident that the US will reach new heights in the very near future. 

3. Consider selling anything you bought because you saw it on wallstreetbets or on YouTube, which is what a lot of this looks like, or at least thoroughly research the company. 

4. It's tempting to keep what's in the red, but it has no bearing on future performance. Hold or don't, but be aware of your own bias and understand that there is zero relationship between a stock being down and future performance. Sometimes they come back, other times they're red for a reason and don't come back, or if they do your money is still better put elsewhere. 

My PERSONAL sell list, and this is pure opinion because there are arguments either way, would definitely include: GOOG, TSLA, PYPL, META, and SOFI. I would personally consider keeping JPM, NIO, and AMD. Again, this is personal opinion, take it as such. I would also go way more than 25% int'l, but one can make a reasonable argument for anywhere between 25% and 100% non-US, so my previous rec was conservative because if in doubt it's better to stay closer to the status quo."

All-in on the US with zero diversification is never a ""good"" idea per se, even for a US bull, but right now it's just delusional. The US market is massively overvalued, to say nothing of the current chaos. You also have a lot of overlap, I assume unintentionally, that overexposes you to certain stocks. Dump all of this, put at least 25% into Europe and 25% into ROW, and allocate the rest as you see fit if you prefer a US-heavy portfolio. That's still a ton of exposure to a market that is begging to collapse at any moment and underperform for the next 5-10 years. You seem to have a preference for small cap, which is fine if that's your thing, so 30% VOO 10% Small Cap 10% non-equity might be a reasonable allocation."

Even without Trump there's a very strong argument for exiting the US altogether because valuations are so off the charts. Of course I get the logic of always wanting US exposure and that's fair enough, but... not this. 

A lot of this stuff is completely redundant, there's no point in complicating it. 

If you want a simple formula, take 3 broad-market ETFs: 1 US, 1 Europe, 1 Rest of World and invest 1:1:1. It's very diversified and gives you a slice of everything along with a strong safety net. 

A note on dividend funds: they are not. free. money. They pay a dividend, and that's great if you're retired and just want a steady flow of cash, but not when you're 22. You CAN leave a bit of room for them depending on your priorities and risk tolerance, but understand that you're trading a small payout each month for actual growth. 

In general, there's no point in investing ""bit by bit"" - in an average case you'll lose out more by waiting. Of course it's possible that the market will crash tomorrow and you'll be grateful you waited, but it's also possible that it will go on a tear and never come back down. Nobody can predict the future, especially right now. If you're diversified (1:1:1) and you don't need the money for at least a decade, put it in now and don't even look at it, just check back in 5 years."

I wouldn't even bother to consider what to buy/sell in this case. I would just dump everything and start fresh.

It's a standard portfolio setup, extremely well diversified, and affords both a safety net and opportunity to capitalize on runs in the medium-long term.

I also had a higher allocation in the S&P500 at the time.

And no, the 1/1/1 portfolio is a standard recommendation for set and forget investors, investing internationally is not new, except maybe to people who have never consulted any source except reddit. 

Just ask yourself some common sense questions:

1. Assuming it's 2045 and you have no idea what market conditions are like, do you think it's smart to put 100% of your money in one country and 0% in the rest of the world? If so, why? 

2. Looking at the short/medium term, the US is highly overvalued, currently in the 98th percentile. When you do the math, it's more expensive to buy 80% of the US than it is to buy every other company in the world combined. Some of your individual picks drag you into even more extreme territory? Does that sound like a good deal to you? Why or why not? 

3. Why did you ask for advice on this thread only to react negatively upon receiving the feedback you were presumably seeking. Could you make a thorough argument as to why 100% US is a good strategy, and if so, what is that argument? Would you be confident recommending this allocation to a friend or family member? If you were hiring someone to invest your money, would you hire yourself based on that reaction? If not, who would you hire?

4. Your portfolio is heavily concentrated not just geographically, but also (albeit to a lesser degree) by sector. What justifies that allocation?  

5. Your past investments are not relevant. The fact that you got RR at X price will never help or hurt you at any point in the future. Why did you mention it? Are you confident that this wasn't an emotional reaction? 

Unfortunately ""I'm right and everything else is temporary noise"" is not a rational argument. You either have strong reasons to maintain this portfolio or you do not. That was true a year ago and will be a year from today. Your money is yours to lose and you are not obligated to invest rationally, but very simply it is extremely difficult to see the rationale for this portfolio even discounting the individual companies and any medium-term trends. 

Take a couple of days and put your rationale into writing - geographical allocation, responses to 5-10 year trends, sector allocation, each individual stock etc. Write the strongest possible counterargument to your own justifications, and adjust where you feel your reasoning is weak. If you're going to lose money, it's far better to do so with a strong thesis than it is to lose your life savings because you were too proud and wanted to prove to some stranger on the internet that, apparently, international investing is a week-old idea, the south will rise again, and hell will freeze over any day now."

HOOD’s accounting for the last quarter included an accrual reversal and deferred tax benefit which is why their earnings were inflated. 


And thirdly, investing data suggests that concentration, not diversification drives the greatest returns if you had bothered to do a little research you dimwit. Diversification merely reduces risk.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

That wasn’t happening in times of crisis during that period. It’s not normal for equities to dump and yields to go up as well.

Probably was a heafty valuation at the time and got punished for the slowing growth. 

However, they are projecting somewhat more growth this year:

America spends around $500 billion each year on Chinese products. Mainly things that America needs and has no capacity to make*: electronics devices/parts, machinery, chemicals, clothing, metal.

*Once they develop the infrastructure, decades from now, they're going to have a hell of a job getting these things made cheaply because American don't want to/can't live off minimum wage jobs.

Good luck, though!"

The only silver lining here is that someday these dinosaurs of the 20th century, the Xi's and Trumps and Putins of the world will die, and their bullshot outdated way of looking at the world will, for the most part, die with them.

It's 4 am at the time of writing this... It's cold, damn cold... And it's raining..... 

I had a terrible dream last night... 

I bought a Tesla.
Convertible Roadster. Real slick. Real expensive. Looked like it came with a gluten allergy and a superiority complex.

So I take it to the car wash—and who’s there, scrubbin’ bumpers like it’s community service?

*Elon Musk*

He’s got a sponge in one hand and a vendetta in the other. Scuffs up the paint, dents the fender, and when I point it out—politely, mind you—he flips. Starts yellin’, blamin’ me for the car’s feelings or some AI ethics thing. So we start fightin'. Hands are thrown. It’s like two dads at a Little League game, but with more crypto energy.

Mid-fight, he stops. Looks me dead in the eye and says, “Let’s reset. Come to my house. We'll talk reparations.”

Now normally, I don’t follow billionaires home—but I’m curious. So I go. Mansion looks like the inside of a SpaceX rocket mated with a spirit Halloween.

And that’s when it happens…

He turns into a giant chicken.

Feathers. Beady eyes. Elon Chicken. Starts flappin’ and peckin’ and cluckin’ about innovation. Yuuuuge fight ensues.. I got the E chicken in a headlock, my heart’s racin’, feathers everywhere—

And that’s when I wake up.

Chest poundin’. Drenched in sweat. Thinkin’...

“What a terrible dream.”

...

Then it hits me—

My TSLA puts are gonna print.

Best damn dream I’ve had all year!!! 



Signed,

Uncle Johnny

Dream Survivor. Put Buyer. Scotch Drinker."

The Fed will quietly print just enough money to buy all the bonds back from China if they sell them.  

Amazon and some smaller importers have already canceled their orders from China. Apple is aggressively moving more iPhone production to India.

The situation in China is bad.

Larger players in China can move goods to a third country to avoid tariffs.  The smaller players are the ones who got shafted.

(As to why Jefferson did this, basically he was trying desperately to avoid the War of 1812 from ever happening. Britain was starting to board US vessels and seize former British citizens who had immigrated to the US, accusing them of deserting the British navy. Jefferson was trying to avoid having one of these incidents drag the US into war with Britain by making sure that there were no US ships in European waters)"

In a trade war, being lower on the vertical stack puts you in a superior position - your industries still *function*, and you can immediately start working on re-orienting your exports into other markets. It sucks, but you've got the tools on hand to do it.

For us, our industries are all way up the vertical stack - they'll basically just choke when supply is cut off. We can scramble to find other sources, but until we do, our industries go idle, and spinning up our own domestic sources will take years.

And that spin-up effort itself grows much more expensive, because the raw materials to do it are now in short supply or increased in cost - it's the opposite in China where they'll face sudden surpluses of raw materials and very low prices to construct new industries to fill out the upper end of the vertical integration."

That “bit of extra” is called the yield. A Treasury is basically that. It’s an instrument where the government borrows money and agrees to pay back more after a period of time. So the 10-year Treasury is a loan the government will pay back in 10 years with a little extra.

Now let’s say I buy a Treasury for $10 and get $11 back from the government over 10 years. That’s a 10% return over its life, or about 0.96% annually if compounded, but roughly 1%/year if simplified. We call that a 1% yield.

Why does dumping bonds make the price go down? Simple supply and demand — just like selling stocks makes their prices go down. If you suddenly sell a lot of anything, the price drops because supply overwhelms demand. Now, China has almost $800 billion in Treasuries (and they are also a big buyer, which creates demand). Japan holds even more — about $1 trillion. That can move markets.

And remember, even if China holds only a small fraction of total outstanding Treasuries, what matters is the float — that is, how much is being bought and sold at a given time. For example, say typically 1% of the houses in your city are on sale at any time. Now some real estate mogul decides to sell all his houses, which make up 2% of the housing stock. That’s a small fraction of all the homes in the city — but it triples the supply that’s for sale. There aren’t enough buyers for that. So prices drop. A lot.

Even though it’s just a 2% change in total inventory, it’s a huge disruption to the normal market activity. Japan and China can flush the Treasury market in a similar way. If they sell a lot at once, there simply won’t be enough buyers ready with cash — and that’s what we call a liquidity crunch or low-liquidity situation.  Since China is a big Treasury buyer, they can affect the demand side too by stopping their buying.  

Remember that bond that paid $11 that I bought for $10??  Now let’s say I sell that bond for $8 because someone is dumping bonds and prices are falling. That bond still pays $11 over its life. So the person who buys it from me is getting a $3 gain on an $8 investment — or a 37.5% total return over 10 years. That translates into about 3.2% annually (compounded) — a big jump from the original 1% yield!

So as you can see, as bond prices go down, yields go up — they move inversely.
Now, the next time the government wants to borrow money, it can’t offer the old 1% yield anymore. Why? Because people can just go buy that 3.2% yielding bond on the open market. To compete, the government has to raise the interest rate on new bonds to match what the market is demanding. So it ends up paying more to borrow money.

Why Is This Important?

Because the 10-year Treasury yield is a benchmark — many other loans (like mortgages, car loans, student loans, and business loans) key off of it.

So when the yield goes up, it means the U.S. government has to pay more to borrow — and so do you.

Higher yields = higher interest rates across the board.

That’s bad for:

• Homebuyers – higher mortgage rates = higher monthly payments

• Businesses – higher borrowing costs = harder to invest, hire, or expand

• The government – more of the federal budget goes toward interest payments instead of programs like schools or infrastructure

• The stock market – investors shift money out of stocks and into safe, high-yielding bonds, pushing stock prices down

Basically, because so many interest rates are tied to the 10-year Treasury yield, any increase in that yield raises the cost of capital for the entire economy. Getting money becomes more expensive. Business slows down. At the same time, stock prices drop.

It’s a double whammy.

That’s why people watch the health of the Treasury market so closely — because it affects nearly everything in the economy, even if you don’t own a single bond yourself."

You give them money now, and in return, they promise to pay you back later with interest. It’s like you’re the bank, and the government is the borrower.

These bonds are traditionally very safe, the U.S. government almost never misses a payment and they used everywhere: Banks, companies, and even foreign countries buy them to store their money safely.

Selling them off signals fear or mistrust which means the gov has to offer a bigger interest payment to entice people to buy bonds which gets very, very expensive which means less money for essential services the gov provides or job cuts to keep things even.

As far as I understand it, U.S. Treasury bonds are considered one of the safest investments on earth, so their interest rate becomes the starting point (or “floor”) for almost all other interest rates. if they go up so does everything else.

Banks and lenders raise their rates too because if they can earn X% safely from the government, they’ll charge even more to risk lending to people or businesses. That means mortgages, credit cards, student loans, and business loans all get more expensive, which leads to less borrowing, less spending, everything slows down."

comment,2025-04-11 14:29:15,mmkherx,stocks,BREAKING: China raises tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%,someonesgranpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jwkuhb/breaking_china_raises_tariffs_on_us_goods_to_125/,2,,,"Someone else commented this, explains it more than perfectly:

> “Imagine the U.S. government borrows money from people for 10 years and promises to pay them back with a bit of extra money (interest). That “bit of extra” is called the yield. A Treasury is basically that. It’s an instrument where the government borrows money and agrees to pay back more after a period of time. So the 10-year Treasury is a loan the government will pay back in 10 years with a little extra.

> Now let’s say I buy a Treasury for $10 and get $11 back from the government over 10 years. That’s a 10% return over its life, or about 0.96% annually if compounded, but roughly 1%/year if simplified. We call that a 1% yield.

> Why does dumping bonds make the price go down? Simple supply and demand — just like selling stocks makes their prices go down. If you suddenly sell a lot of anything, the price drops because supply overwhelms demand. Now, China has almost $800 billion in Treasuries (and they are also a big buyer, which creates demand). Japan holds even more — about $1 trillion. That can move markets.

> And remember, even if China holds only a small fraction of total outstanding Treasuries, what matters is the float — that is, how much is being bought and sold at a given time. For example, say typically 1% of the houses in your city are on sale at any time. Now some real estate mogul decides to sell all his houses, which make up 2% of the housing stock. That’s a small fraction of all the homes in the city — but it triples the supply that’s for sale. There aren’t enough buyers for that. So prices drop. A lot.

> Even though it’s just a 2% change in total inventory, it’s a huge disruption to the normal market activity. Japan and China can flush the Treasury market in a similar way. If they sell a lot at once, there simply won’t be enough buyers ready with cash — and that’s what we call a liquidity crunch or low-liquidity situation.  Since China is a big Treasury buyer, they can affect the demand side too by stopping their buying.

> Remember that bond that paid $11 that I bought for $10??  Now let’s say I sell that bond for $8 because someone is dumping bonds and prices are falling. That bond still pays $11 over its life. So the person who buys it from me is getting a $3 gain on an $8 investment — or a 37.5% total return over 10 years. That translates into about 3.2% annually (compounded) — a big jump from the original 1% yield!

> So as you can see, as bond prices go down, yields go up — they move inversely. Now, the next time the government wants to borrow money, it can’t offer the old 1% yield anymore. Why? Because people can just go buy that 3.2% yielding bond on the open market. To compete, the government has to raise the interest rate on new bonds to match what the market is demanding. So it ends up paying more to borrow money.

> Why Is This Important?

> Because the 10-year Treasury yield is a benchmark — many other loans (like mortgages, car loans, student loans, and business loans) key off of it.

> So when the yield goes up, it means the U.S. government has to pay more to borrow — and so do you.

> Higher yields = higher interest rates across the board.

> That’s bad for:

> • Homebuyers – higher mortgage rates = higher monthly payments

> • Businesses – higher borrowing costs = harder to invest, hire, or expand

> • The government – more of the federal budget goes toward interest payments instead of programs like schools or infrastructure

> • The stock market – investors shift money out of stocks and into safe, high-yielding bonds, pushing stock prices down

> Basically, because so many interest rates are tied to the 10-year Treasury yield, any increase in that yield raises the cost of capital for the entire economy. Getting money becomes more expensive. Business slows down. At the same time, stock prices drop.

> It’s a double whammy.

> That’s why people watch the health of the Treasury market so closely — because it affects nearly everything in the economy, even if you don’t own a single bond yourself.”"

That's why the yields spiked in the recent days, leading to Trump backtracking on his tariffs. 
  
The market for US bonds is not as strong as it once was, because it relies on a fundamental trust in the US economy. With Trump in charge changing his mind every hour, and waging economic warfare on the rest of the world, that trust and confidence is eroding rapidly."

How well do you know international trade? This whole tariff debacle is about goods, because the US consumes wayyyy more goods than it produces. BUT. The US is a surplus
supplier in services. It is royally fucked if other countries start replacing US services with services from elsewhere. 

Americans so often believe the world needs them more than they need the world and it’s wild. It’s a truly interdependent system.
 
Also, one of the reasons the US has accepted higher tariffs on some goods until now is due to its favourable negotiations on the supply of services. 

Further, the reason for the 90 day tariff pause on some nations is due to other countries completely screwing your bond market, which will tank your economy faster than a trade war. China is one of those countries. For a country with much higher debt than most others, the US is incredibly susceptible to movements in the bond market; which makes it dependent on countries who hold bonds.

I understand the education system in America has been degraded over decades. But it’s so tiring coming on here and reading half ass ignorant comments. It’s ok to not understand this stuff. It’s not ok to just go ‘but murica is the best’. You’re not. You’re borderline third world at this point and the rest of the world is moving on without you. Sort your shit out already."

If China imports anything from US it's mostly tech/services (as anyone else, that's why tariffs based on goods trade balance are just big xD). 


China won't import US cars as Chinese EVs are better, and even in combustion engines other Asian/European brands are better (and ""status"" segment is almost fully European). This also pretty much applies to EU. Tesla sales drop not only because boycott, but also because they are comparable or better alternatives if you want an EV.


China also won't import that many industrial goods from US, as (I) they have most of them in China, and already imported stuff can be mostly replaced by other countries and (II) if they have large local gaps it's mostly in specialty low volume stuff (necessary to build high volume stuff) which is manufactured in Europe (not US) and some high tech stuff (like top end chips)."

It’s not that the 10-year Treasury has to be the benchmark, but it’s the one everyone watches because it hits the sweet spot.

Treasuries (so far) are considered “risk-free.” They’re backed by the U.S. government and are super liquid. That liquidity and low risk give the market a ton of real-time data about inflation expectations and the overall cost of capital. So they’re a natural baseline for figuring out what riskier borrowing should cost.

Imagine you have a friend, Randy Reliable, who’s always good for his money. Everyone is willing to loan him money at 2%. He borrows a lot, so there’s plenty of data on what rate people charge him — and you can be confident that 2% is the right baseline.

Then Sam Suspicious comes along and wants to borrow. You don’t know exactly what to charge him, but since you know what Randy pays, you just add a risk premium to that. That’s how the market treats borrowers — it builds off the known “risk-free” rate.

But why the 10-year Treasury specifically? It’s not too short (like a 2-year), not too long (like a 30-year). It captures market expectations about inflation, economic growth, and Fed policy over a medium-to-long horizon — so it ends up being the go-to reference point for lots of long-term loans."

QT is quantitative tightening -- when the Fed sells treasuries (or lets them naturally mature without replacement) -- so that would actually make things worse! When the Fed buys treasuries that's called quantitative easing. But the money used to pay for those Fed purchases needs to come from somewhere. That somewhere is the dollar supply, which ultimately is from thin air (or, less cynically, the full faith and credit of the United States). That just shifts the pain from interest rates to inflation since the Fed needs to print money to pay for those treasuries. More money in circulation means the dollar is worth less, which is inflation.

So, the Fed has tools to remedy the yield spike risk through QE. But there's no such thing as a free lunch as they say: the price is higher inflation. This is something the Fed generally does not want to happen, especially now."

The U.S. rolls over debt constantly. So if yields rise, new bonds cost more to issue, and over time, that makes debt servicing more expensive. It’s like refinancing your mortgage — rising rates mean higher monthly payments next time around.   And the US basically refinances a small portion of its debt essentially continuously."

The bonds themselves are auctioned off to those willing to accept the lowest interest on them, but they can also be sold on the open Market.
The Problem is, when other countries sell off a huge amount of Bonds, it drives up the amount of interest that has to be given on New treasury bonds in order to sell more bonds, which is necessaty to pay out the bonds that are continously running out. That puts a higher strain on the finacials of the US, while also driving down the value of the Dollar as people start moving their money into other values like other currencies or Gold.


Tldr : it further damages the economy, the reliability of the Dollar, and might even make the us default on it's loans if things go really bad, but that is not too likely. Still, that fact that it has even come this far is horrid."

China was poor like a half generation ago. Most of people there know how to function in actually bad times. So short term pain is manageable (long term isn't, as CCP legitimacy is based on the growth which so far was easy to deliver due low base).


The last time Americans got hit by a short term lack of prosperity was GFC, and you still somehow won it (compared vs Europe). The actual problem is that even low-mid income Americans usually do not realize how much worse it can possibly be and do not realize how much more affluent is average American vs average Japanese or French (especially vs early 2000s)."

So if Randy suddenly develops a meth addiction, not a terrible problem right away, but he then starts telling everyone that, '... only suckers pay back their loans...' or '... I will punch you in the face if you don't stop hassling me...'  You get the drift.

My thinking is that Randy does not look quite as reliable as he once did, so counterparties start thinking about lending less money to Randy.  (Or charge him a little more.)  Does that sound right?"

We can find other countries to import the majority of our goods from, albeit at a higher price, but there isn’t another gluttonous America for China to export half a trillion dollars worth of goods to each year. 

If they lose a significant share of the US import market, China will be in a chokehold. That’s the entire goal. The US will suffer for it, but China will suffer worse. Not to mention this dick measuring contest doesn’t look good for China either. Both countries are actively destroying other trade relationships because of this pissing match, and the US will have a much easier time recovering from that than China will. 

It’s been pretty clear from the start that these tariffs aren’t about improving our economy but destroying China’s. I’m not saying I think it’s a good idea or I agree with this, but it’s not entirely brainless."

And only because a few hundred billionaires owns more wealth while the rest of you hold next to nothing (while simping for the wealthy). Your president is currently crashing the economy and the currency, so let's see.

Most powerful - militarily, sure - because you've prioritized that over services for your own citizens. Used to be the greatest soft power as well, but your president also ruined that.

Most free is the dumbest shit I've ever heard. It's literally common practice now for the federal state to abduct random citizens without trial to a concentration camp-like prison in El Salvador, and even if they admit they did it wrongfully, they claim there's no way to get them out. Most Americans live paycheck-to-paycheck, many with no healthcare or any wealth. A narcissistic president who says he's serious about a third (illegal) term, and who became a billionaire by launching a memecoin created to accept bribes days before the inauguration. A political system that has effectively been bought to the point where none of the chambers dare to do anything to piss off Elon Musk out of fear that he'll financially support someone else come next election. A fifth of all Americans want to move abroad. Legal companies are being closed for supporting cases against the government. 2/3 of the entities in the separation of power are controlled by one man, and he's actively seeking to overturn and destroy the last third. You're effectively months away from a dictatorship.

There's nothing free about Americans. You live in an oligarchy created to enrich the president and his friends, but you're too stupid, uneducated and brainwashed to notice it. If you visited one of the Nordic countries for a week, your brain would melt by how it's possible for the working class to actually have control of the collective government and ensure livable conditions.

It's also incredibly embarrassing for you that you have to have a (from your pov) foreigner explaining this to you. There are literally millions if not billions of people outside of the US who understand your situation better than you do, who see it clearer than you."

Btw if you think Trump is doing this to stop China's abuse of its own citizens, you really don't understand what's happening right now. Trump doesn't care one bit about how China treats their own citizens. He is doing what he does because he wants to have similar powers in US and part of it requires making sure China doesn't have an edge on us economically.

Ironically what he is doing now ensures it will happen."

>President Donald Trump’s volatile trade war, which threatens higher inflation, has significantly weighed on Americans’ moods these past few months. That malaise worsened leading up to Trump’s announcement last week of sweeping tariffs, according to the survey.

If the dems didn't have Harris or Clinton, Trump would've never won twice.  Dems are dumb. Stop telling Americans to vote for a woman.  Even American women don't like having a woman president.  They gave two elections away because they wanted to push for a woman presidency.  A woman as the top leader is really rare even in the world.  Barely enough to count more than a half a dozen.  And even so, only Merkel was noteworthy and powerful.   Everyone acknowledged her.

Can we just go back to the norms, and give us a 40-50s years old man to vote for instead?  I am getting tired of voting for women or 70s and almost dead old men.  Where is our handsome and good-looking president?  America can only be respected if we have a young and good-looking president like JFK.  Make America Good-looking Again.

Edit: Downvote all you want.  But it is the truth.  Losing female voters to Trump is already a disaster.  Dems threw away two elections and caused all of this mess because they gave us Clinton and Harris instead of going to the basics, giving the public a good-looking man to vote for.

Harris was not well received in the 2020 primary though. There were people like Whitmer, Pritzker, Beshear, Shapiro that would have put their hats in the ring, and then who knows who might have come out of nowhere to build a movement (like Obama or Sanders).

It's impossible to overstate how bad the Biden admin media strategy was through 2020-2024, there was literally 0 pushback to the republicans because Biden was not capable of leading one. As a result all we ever heard were republican talking points. A vigorous dem primary with a not 82 year old candidate would have completely changed that media environment and ultimately completely changed the race.

Like Rogan was a Sanders guy until very recently. A different candidate might have embraced Rogan and brought him into the moderate or left leaning ecosystem. Biden and then Harris/their people were just so completely incompetent at media."

Sanders was never part of the dem party, while I agree with most of his messages he is a terrible politician was completely incapable of building a movement behind him. Trump and Sanders in 2016 are similar in that they were anti-establishment, however Trump was effective at building a movement, Sanders did not and in fact I'd argue that Sanders did more to help elect Trump than anyone else.

Shocking.  Women hate each other more than men hate each other.  This is why dems will keep losing because of people like you screaming SeXIsm!111!!  No.  Dems should never listen to the minority's voice and opinion.  The whole world don't, so why do they keep pushing for this woman presidency stuff, and gave two elections away to Trump?

I'm gurantee all these China supporters are either bots, CCP controlled, or liberals who live in big cities.  I think they need to take a drive through smaller towns and cities to see what China has done to this country and how our previous government sold out the lower and middle class so that they could bloat their stocks.

Trump himself even said he paused because the bond markets were getting “yippy” and lots of sources say the bond market crash was his main reason for the pause. 

Today bond yields have spiked just as high as they were when Trump enacted his 90 day pause. He clearly cares about this measure given the action he took a few days ago. Could this continued sell off on bonds cause Trump to back off of China? 

According the the FT, ten minutes ago, talking about bond yields today: “They point to a complete loss of faith in the strongest bond market in the world.”

I know I’m the one who asked the question, but in my opinion it seems like there’s a decent chance this will cause Trump to back off, because otherwise this will lead to a much larger crisis, with the U.S losing its reserve currency status and the debt becoming more expensive than whatever we may generate from tariffs. He already backed off once for the same reason….

I don't think this is causal. Even if he backs off, the U.S. will continue to lose its status as the reserve currency holder, because trust in our country has eroded. Trust isn't a switch to be turned on and off at will, which Trump does (classic textbook narcissism)."

Literally every country with trade deficit buys and holds dollars and dollar denominated assets. Trump wants to reduce trade deficit to zero, it would mean no need for these assets. This is what is going to crash the bond market and strip the dollar of its position as reserve currency of the world. Trump seems to be too stupid to understand it and too stubborn to listen to people who know the subject. Unless he completely abandons his idiotic idea of resetting the trade to 19 century level, we are doomed no matter what. Once countries begin to dump US treasury bonds only two choices will remain:

1. The Fed intervenes and buys them up. It will flood the market with cash and produce inflation on the level we’ve never seen before. 

2. The Fed doesn’t intervene, bond yields go up to junk level, interest rates increase to 15-20%.

America will be “great” indeed…"

Once the Fed starts cutting — and they will if Trump applies enough pressure (like crashing the market) — bond yields will fall regardless because cuts are ultimately more powerful than external selling pressure.

Trump’s strategy is very “rip the Band-Aid off,” force the pain now, so the Fed has to act. Historically, market instability, not just inflation, is a huge driver for Fed pivots. The real bottleneck has just been getting inflation closer to 2%, but if markets tank hard enough, they won’t wait — they’ll start easing even if inflation isn’t perfectly at target yet.

Bottom line: Fed > China.
And once the Fed moves, yields are coming down hard."

But it'll somehow be different this time because... ""5D chess"" being played by someone a 7 year old could whoop at checkers or some nonsense. So exhausting to hear people keep preaching to keep the faith and trust in their dear leader when facts, logic, economic data, and history all strongly suggest this is an exceptionally self-destructive move.

post,2025-04-11 13:06:55,1jwpf33,stocks,"Formerly Stable US Treasuries Are Trading Like Risky Assets; 2008-esque in Warning to Trump, US Dollar tanks MASSIVELY",KriosDaNarwal,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jwpf33/formerly_stable_us_treasuries_are_trading_like/,487,15.0,0.97,"***Data sourced via Bloomberg:***

When the US does something truly self-defeating and stupid, the natural response of currency traders is to seek an Alpine sanctuary. The Swiss franc is regarded as the safest of havens. So it’s significant that the dollar just endured its worst day compared to the Swiss Franc since 2015, falling more than 3% to take it to a level last touched during the debt ceiling debacle of August 2011. 

Essentially, the US very nearly decided to default on its debt when it didn’t have to. The latest rush to the Swiss redoubt suggests that the market thinks that the Liberation Day tariffs, subsequently retracting some of them, and the scarcely credible 145% levies on Chinese goods constitute the stupidest acts of US economic policy since then. The selloff intensified in Asian trading. At one point, the dollar had dropped more than 5% since Wednesday’s announced climbdown over reciprocal tariffs.

One logical explanation for a weakening dollar after strong inflation numbers would center on bond yields. All else equal, lower inflation makes it easier to cut rates, and will bring down short-term yields. The differential between two-year yields has been a key driver of the exchange rate and lower US yields should mean a weaker dollar. 

The problem with this theory is that the differential has widened sharply in the US favor of late. The dollar’s slump has come as Treasury yields have risen sharply above German bunds — itself a remarkable occurrence only weeks after Germany committed to its biggest fiscal expansion in generations (largely in response to the Vance speech as it decided it could no longer treat Washington as a reliable ally).

Short-term yields are more important to the currency, but the move in longer bonds has been more startling. The real 30-year yield, as pure a measure of the cost of long-term money as exists, has now reached a high only previously seen during the spasm that followed the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008.

It's hard to cast this as anything other than a significant loss of confidence in the US. It doesn’t have to be terminal sure. The shock of the debt-ceiling crisis in 2011 turned out to be a major turning point that was followed by a decade of American Exceptionalism. But the moves in the bond and currency markets — to a far greater extent than stocks (which by the way endured a massive selloff Thursday and gave up more than half of Wednesday’s gains) — ram home that a lot is at stake. And the US is currently embarked on what appears to be a wholesale change in foreign policy, not struggling to get things back to normal.

How could this crisis of confidence come just as the US has come through its inflation trial? The problem is that almost all economic data is now coming off as backward-looking. Nobody cares. Similarly with the corporate earnings season, kicked off Friday morning by the big banks, there will be minimal interest in how things went in the first quarter. All now depends on what CEOs have to say about how they’ll live in a new world in which the US and China have effectively imposed a trade embargo on each other.

TL:DR; - The dollar just suffered its worst day against the Swiss franc since 2015, as global markets fled to safety amid what they see as economic self-sabotage by the U.S. From erratic tariff whiplash to sky-high levies on Chinese goods, traders are treating Washington’s latest moves as a full-blown confidence crisis. Bond markets are flashing red, real 30-year yields now rival the panic levels seen after Lehman’s collapse. Even strong inflation data can’t paper over the chaos, as markets look past stats and earnings to the looming question: how will companies, and countries, navigate a world where the U.S. has torched economic diplomacy? This isn't just a stumble; it feels like the start of something seismic."

The people in this country elected him again. This time in just 80 days, he has wrongly wielded emergency powers to unilaterally tariff the entire world, started calling for the annexation of Canada, Greenland, and Panama, begun disappearing people with no due process to an El Salvador concentration camp, turned his back on Ukraine and NATO, fired hundreds of thousands of federal workers, gutted our health department, fired the independent monitors, and now placed a more than 100% tariff (which Americans will have to pay) on our largest trading partner. Oh and he is about to pass a huge tax giveaway to the super wealthy that will explode our debt. All with the help of the GOP who are cheerleading this.

The rest of the world is decoupling from the US and the dollar and it is fucking obvious. It also is not something that can be undone by apologizing. The world has no reason to ever trust us again. Our markets will suffer that in a huge way."

Instead think it is a broad de-risking move out of USD due to the loss of U.S. exceptionalism, political uncertainty, and the potential for unilateral stagflation. While not a great time to hold USD, also think these flows cannot be sustained.

""In order to achieve its investment objective, each of the Funds intends to invest in financial instruments (“Financial Instruments”) in the

manner and to the extent described herein. Financial Instruments are instruments whose value is derived from the value of an underlying asset,

rate or benchmark (such asset, rate or benchmark, a “Reference Asset”) and include futures contracts, swap agreements, forward contracts,

option contracts, and other instruments. The Funds will not invest directly in any commodities or currencies.""

Let me emphasize: ""**not invest directly in any commodities**""

So what exactly is happening here? It's just a fund. A pile of money, operated by people, that speculates on contracts based on some set of rules.

I learned this the hard way having ""invested"" in aluminum a while back. There was a point where I had to sign some promise of receipt for some trucks of aluminum, and I freaked out. So then I started to go the ETF route, where the feature is that I was no longer exposed to delivery risk, but the outcome is that I don't actually get any real aluminum if I ever actually wanted aluminum.

So in the case of ""gold"" this is feature is actually completely opposite to what people imagine they're buying when they buy ""gold"". If the markets actually tank, where will you get the gold? How? The funds that hold these are likely banks, and those banks are likely exposed also, so it's simply dollars at the end of it.

I actually know some people that wanted to get around an oil speculation ETF, so they actually bought the contracts, and then when storage wasn't available anywhere, they had to pay money for someone else to pickup their oil contracts because where are they going to even park tankers full of crude oil?

It's pretty crazy how stuff works under the hood. Gotta read the prospectus.

Also remember: when sh\* hits the fan, banks are made whole first, before investors.

CORRECTION:  
Earlier, I had the wrong tab loaded and was actually copying from UGL instead of GLD.

GLD looks much better under the hood:  
""The custodian is HSBC Bank plc (the “Custodian”) and is responsible for the safekeeping of the Trust’s gold bars transferred to it in connection with thecreation of Baskets by Authorized Participants. The Custodian also facilitates the transfer of gold in and out of the Trust through gold accounts itmaintains for Authorized Participants and the Trust. The Custodian is a market maker, clearer and approved weigher under the rules of the LBMA.

The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, less the expenses of the Trust’s operations.The Shares are designed for investors who want a cost-effective and convenient way to invest in gold.

At August 31, 2022, the amount of gold owned by the Trust and held by the Custodian in its vault was 31,582,529 ounces, 100% of which is allocatedgold in the form of London Good Delivery gold bars with a market value of $53,698,529,317 based on the LBMA Gold Price PM on August 31, 2022(cost—$50,824,771,861)

The Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust.

Proceeds received by the Trust from the issuance and sale of Baskets consist of gold and, possibly from time to time, cash. Pursuant to the Trust Indenture, during the life of the Trust the gold and any cash will only be (1) held by the Trust, (2) distributed to Authorized Participants in connection with the redemption of Baskets or (3) sold or disbursed as needed to pay the Trust’s ongoing expenses  
  
Baskets may be created or redeemed only by Authorized Participants. Each Authorized Participantmust (1) be a registered broker-dealer or other securities market participant such as a bank or otherfinancial institution which is not required to register as a broker-dealer to engage in securitiestransactions, (2) be a participant in DTC (“DTC Participant”), (3) have entered into an agreementwith the Trustee and the Sponsor (the “Participant Agreement”),and (4) have established an unallocated gold account with the Custodian (the “AuthorizedParticipant Unallocated Account”). The Participant Agreement provides the procedures for thecreation and redemption of Baskets and for the delivery of gold and any cash required for suchcreations or redemptions. As of the date of this prospectus, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC,Goldman, Sachs & Co., Goldman Sachs Execution & Clearing, L.P., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc.,J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley & [Co.LLC](http://Co.LLC), RBC Capital Markets LLC, UBS Securities LLC and Virtu Americas LLC are the onlyAuthorized Participants. A list of the current Authorized Participants can be obtained from theTrustee or the Sponsor.""

In this case, you're buying shares of a Trust that is governed by Swiss governance. At least, they have the gold, but it is controlled by a Trust that has been established, but in the event of trouble, you will have to somehow transfer your ""ownership"" to another country that is accredited as a broker/dealer that can access this trust in order to extract your value back from it."

Share, rather than in connection with the creation or redemption of

The market price of the Shares of GLDM is not identical to the end-

of-day NAV per Share. However, the market price per Share is

expected to be close to the intra-day value of GLDM, which is

provided on the Sponsor’s website. Investors are able to use the

 CEO Larry Fink told CNBC on Friday that he thinks the U.S. economy has weakened to the point of growth possibly turning negative.

“I think we’re very close, if not in, a recession now,” Fink said on “Squawk on the Street.”

Fears of an economic slowdown have risen sharply since President Donald Trump unveiled widespread tariffs last week, sparking a sell-off in the stock market. Trump on Wednesday announced that he was pausing some of those import levies for 90 days, but that move is not enough to restore confidence in the economy, Fink said.

Nothing that happened in the last week was good for the future of the US economy or our public markets. It doesn't all unwind at once. Expect a lot of volatility as we battle on price during these uncertain times.

My instinct is that we will suffer more pain before true reciprocal trade takes place. Before they abandon the policy altogether and reduce the rates with China. Trump isn't negotiating in good faith. They aren't even using data to make their decisions. Just a simple trade deficit equation that they still ignored with all countries we had trade surpluses with. The USMCA took 2 years to negotiate. How will we negotiate trade deals with 100+ countries in 90 days?

What's the intended goal of the tariffs?

Tax Revenue? (Thats a tax on the consumer, largest increase in decades)

Reduce trade deficits? (Trade deficits will go down as US consumers have less buying power. Not good)

Job growth? (Creating inefficiencies will not increase job growth)

Bring more investment to the US? (You just made the US a less business friendly environment)

Reciprocal tariffs with a goal to reduce them to 0? (THIS SHOULD BE THE GOAL!)

Diversify our supply chain out of China? (Wise, but we should let the rest of Asia pick up the slack without any tariffs and be more thoughtful of the time it takes for this transition to take place)

The tariff messaging changes by the minute, and not one person in the administration can clarify the reason, or endgame. Why the broad based tariffs were so illogical. How is a business supposed to operate in this environment? You can't shift your supply chain in a day or a week. Even 3 months isn't enough time for this to be effective. It will take years to accomplish the China goal."

The public isn't aware of some of our biggest industries like manufacturing, military, aerospace, relies on refined earth metals where China apparently controls over 80% of the refining process.

Then another possible factor is China was a little silent and was strategically planning until releasing news this morning of raising their own tariffs onto US to 125% so we will see how this goes over the day

Then another factor is the public is ignorant about the importance of the status on US treasury bonds + have little to no financial literacy thanks to the educational system

- tariffs ARE a “negotiation tactic” in his tiny orange brain
- he DOES watch the markets and not only that the pain is felt, it creates tensions in the WH

This translates to the fact that Trump might have lost his main “card” which was doubt. Objectively speaking, none of this has anything to do with economics, it’s all the ideology of one dude.

Counterintuitively, the higher the tariffs between the US and China go, the less serious they are, as China stated this morning. Completely blocking trade between the 2 countries is not realistic in the near or medium term, however tariffs above 100% would do exactly this. 

So, going back to square one, just as the “Liberation Day” tariffs made no sense and would have blocked the country therefore the “90 day pause” presented as a negotiation success, tariffs above 100% between the US and China make no sense either and you should expect a similar outcome as for the other “75 countries” (which by the way we don’t even know who they are, if indeed there are 75 or not, etc).

How much more would you realistically expect the global markets to crash because of one dudes spastic ramblings?"

Fyi you are not going to get a 100% drop, people will still use Google and Android, companies will still make more money than others which will increase their valuation.

US 2024 imports: ~$4.1 trillion

China 2024: we imported ~$460 billion @ 145% is an increase of ~$670 billion

Canada 2024: we imported ~$400 billion @ 25% fentanyl rate makes increase ~$100 billion

Mexico 2024: we imported ~$500 billion @ 25% fentanyl rate makes increase $125 billion

Remaining world 2024: let’s just say it’s $2.7 trillion at 10% rate makes increase $270 billion

($670B+100B+125B+270B) / $4.11T = 28.3% increase. This of course excludes certain current trade agreement items not covered and semiconductors, certain other items etc. but also excludes how this impacts domestic supply chains and current retaliatory tariffs impact as well. On top of it, our currency is dropping which also ignores the increasing cost in USD of these imports relative to world currency. Then you have to factor in people just not shipping us product at these rates and the top line hit along with brand of our product in other countries.

All this to say, no one knows, but it feels like the US market should be lower than 8% down from Election Day (though I understand because Trump could unwind any time) based on that and the outlook if this continues is not rosy."

Right now it’s looking like either a price increase for services (there are 10 employees) or charging CC swipe fees. She already pays a generous commission to her stylists (at the top end of industry standard). She’s also keeping in mind that clients costs outside of the salon are going impact their decisions to book appointments. 

The rub is either of these moves can drive away clients so she’s really struggling with how to handle this and I don’t blame her. It’s scary to be at the mercy of some fuckery you have no control over that impacts your livelihood and flies in the face of how hard she worked to get the business where it is. 

It’s really a no win situation and extremely frustrating."

I think he didn't expect the market collapse and that many of his friends actually started complaining when they lost millions.

This is the trade version of the Cuban missile crisis, it's possible that the US economy will explode if the current administration continues on its path, but it's also possible that cooler heads prevail and some kind of reasonable agreement in reached. Though Trump is no JFK, I'll tell you that. Imagine a missile crisis with Lemay in charge.

The markets need to arbitrage between several scenarios, including a still somewhat possible scenario where some kind of reasonable agreement is found.

The sad thing is that some kind of gradual, moderate, selective, targeted tariffs do make sense, but Trump's amateurish approach has made sure that tariffs can never be mentioned by serious politicians & economists ever again out of fear of being associated with the current idiocy."

Most trade deals take *years* to negotiate. You think the completely dysfunctional and incompetent Trump administration is going to negotiate dozens of trade deals *simultaneously* in less than 3 months???

>I don't get what you think is happening, the market has lost 30% of its value. 

The valuations of many companies are still sky-high compared with how badly impacted their revenues and profits will be over the coming months. Also not a single index is down 30% no clue where that number came from. 

>Fyi you are not going to get a 100% drop, people will still use Google and Android, companies will still make more money than others which will increase their valuation.

No one is expecting a 100% drop, obviously. Most companies will still suffer significantly under the tariffs, which will drive major losses in revenue and profits as I noted. Google is a good example, its highly dependent on ad revenue, which is going to drop majorly in a recession

>Someone made the point trade with the USA is like 0.5% of China GDP, same with the USA.

This is an incredibly stupid way of thinking about the impact of tariffs."

But people going out of business is tangible in a very different way. Trump and the GOP own it hard as the current crisis is completely manufactured and branded by Trump.

Summary by Bloomberg Al

■ President Donald Trump has asked the US Supreme Court to allow him to immediately fire top officials at two independent agencies.

■ The case is testing a 90-year-old Supreme Court ruling that lets Congress shield high-ranking officials from being fired by the president.

The outcome could determine whether Trump has the power to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and could also impact the job security of other agency officials.

President Donald Trump asked the US Supreme Court to let him immediately fire top officials at two independent agencies, filing an emergency request in a case that could bolster White House control over federal regulators.
The filing comes after a federal appeals court on Monday said National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox and Merit Systems Protection Board member Cathy Harris can stay in their jobs while a legal fight plays out.
The case is testing a 90-year-old Supreme Court ruling that let Congress shield high-ranking officials from being fired by the president, paving the way for the independent agencies that now proliferate across the US government.
More recent Supreme Court rulings have called the 1935 precedent into question, and the Trump administration said in February it would push to get the ruling overturned or at least sharply limited. The legal wrangling ultimately could test whether Trump has the power to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
The Supreme Court in recent years has chipped away at Humphrey’s Executor, as the New Deal-era ruling is known. The court said in 2020 that the president could fire the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for any reason, striking down job protections Congress had created for that position. The court said the Constitution’s separation of powers precluded an arrangement that left such a powerful executive branch figure unaccountable to the president.
The key question in the Harris and Wilcox cases is whether the same reasoning applies to multi-member agencies. Wilcox was replaced as NLRB chair by Trump on Jan. 20 and fired a week later. Harris was serving as chair of the merit board when Trump removed her in early February.
The administration is also defending against a lawsuit by two Democratic FTC commissioners fired by Trump. That case could pose an even more direct challenge to Humphrey’s Executor."

If he takes control of the fed, the economy is fully politicized and the great American economic machine is 100% over and dead. The last person to play politics with the fed was Nixon, and we ended up with some of the worst economic periods as a direct result of it. 

I don’t care if you like Powell or not, he’s the fed chair, and is meant to be a non-political entity because the entire point is that the every time the fed has been played with politically, it’s caused severe, serious, and impactful economic consequences. Every single time. There’s a reason every successful country has separated their federal banks and monetary policies from the political offices. 

It might actually happen. We might actually see the US lose its status as an economic superpower and leader in our lifetimes. We might actually see the dollar no longer be used as the world currency. That’s fucking insane, and our checks and balances don’t care. What a failure of every single republican who kisses Trump’s asshole, and of the minority of complicit and enabling democrats. Literally a matter of like 20 people could end all of this, and the US could continue its economic dominance in the world. But they won’t. "

I wish the internet existed the way it did in the early 2000s during the Soviet union. I'd love to read message boards describing what people thought 5-10 years before the whole thing broke down.


And then the aftermath of people picking at the corpse and becoming absurdly wealthy after scooping up those state assets.


Republicans have had a multi generation plan to create a partisan supreme court. The fact that the court is on the wrong side of so many issues whether it's campaign contributions, environmental policy or what a woman can do with her own body is a sign that they've been largely successful. If Sonia Sotomayor steps down, one president will have chosen 4 supreme court justices that are friendly to him. He is going to do to America what he's done to his other businesses. Bankrupt it and then run away.


I think democrats as a brand might be done after Trump. For years they were in power and they failed to exercise party discipline and vision. The whole world is watching what a political party can achieve with long term planning(buying up local media to manufacture consent, building a massive ""knowledge"" network of think tanks to inform policies at every level of government, focusing on getting as much judges as they can on their side) and exercising STRICT party discipline and solidarity. Trump is the fruit sprouted from a tree that was planted 92 years ago after the failure of the business plot. The greediest people you can imagine didn't take it lying down and worked behind the scenes for years to get to this point. Trump is going to dismantle whatever shreds are left of the new deal and return America fully to the business environment that necessitated the creation of things like social security to begin with. The men who tried to undo the new deal have finally gotten their revenge. I guess we can take solace in the fact that none of them(i hope) are alive to see it.


I'm so glad I've diversified my portfolio and cashed out 75% of my American holdings. The only thing worse than losing a few thousand is losing double or more of that amount."

In his simple low IQ mind he believes that lowering interest rates will have an equalizing impact on the markets.

More chaos, misery, destruction, and death.

Trump belongs in a prison cell, not the Whitehouse.

Can anyone really doubt anymore that the goal here is to destroy the United States entirely? Burn it all to the ground? Doesn't even matter anymore if it's at the behest of Putin and Russia, the end result is going to be the same: No more United States. They'll install the Authoritarian Theocratic Totalitarian Dictatorship they've wanted all along. There won't be any 'civil rights' or even 'human rights' anymore, just the Police State, and anyone (like me, for instance) that opposes or criticizes Trump and The State will get black-bagged and dropped in some foreign death-camp to die a horrifying death.

You want to blame someone, go bang on your local Republican voter who was so stupid as to vote for Trump and support the Fascist Pig Party, aka 'Republicans', because they're the ones that ultimately enabled all this chaos, misery, destruction, and death to happen now, they're the ones that ultimately have to bang on their 'representatives' (as if they'll listen?) to get rid of Trump and his co-conspirators -- assuming that is that THEY aren't all the co-conspirators that seek to burn the Constitution and the rest of the country with it."

My opinion is that this  is more or less the end of america it doesnt matter anymore if we elect another democrat or republican we have shown that our checks and balances are not that of the world and its people but that of a very few and rich people. Also regardless of how much restriction and checks we put in place no one will ever EVER believe americans again.

Trump has not asked for such authority, and even if he did:

""The Government also suggested that the Federal Reserve Board is a close historical analog for the CFPB. Brief for Petitioners 23; Tr. of Oral Arg. 41. But that setup should not be seen as a model for other Government bodies. The Board, which is funded by the earnings of the Federal Reserve Banks, 12 U. S. C. §§243, 244, is a unique institution with a unique historical background. It includes the creation and demise of the First and Second Banks of the United States, as well as the string of financial panics (in 1873, 1893, and 1907) that were widely attributed to the country’s lack of a national bank. See generally O. Sprague, History of Crises Under the National Banking System, S. Doc. No. 538, 61st Cong., 2d Sess. (1910). The structure adopted in the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 represented an intensely-bargained compromise between two insistent and influential camps: those who wanted a largely private system, and those who favored a Government-controlled national bank. See, e.g., R. Lowenstein, America’s Bank 5–8, 113–116, 265 (2015). For Appropriations Clause purposes, the funding of the Federal Reserve Board should be regarded as a special arrangement sanctioned by history.""

comment,2025-04-11 03:28:33,mmi7t9k,stocks,U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rise as Trump tariffs-led sell-off continues,Primsun,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jwfydk/us_10year_treasury_yields_rise_as_trump/,217,,,"While it may seem small in context, the issue is long rates disassociating from the expected path of short rates, and more importantly, liquidity issues in the Treasury market. The Treasury market needs high liquidity to fulfill its role, and if that breaks down, all bets are off. Effectively, if the spike is due to a strong mismatch between demand (which is moving to prefer short maturities as leveraged trades unwind), and inelastic supply of long term debt, rates can rise quickly and remove Treasuries as a source of liquidity.

What is happening right now is similar to what led to the Fed purchasing bonds in mid-March 2020 in response to the last unwinding of leveraged trades. In that period, rates on the 10 Yr spiked from 54 bps to 118+ bps over 12 days as liquidity in the market melted away.

There are two potential solutions. Option 1 is the U.S. Treasury rapidly adjusts its issuance towards short maturity bonds, correcting the mismatch and reducing long supply, or engages in buybacks funded by short issues. (Note this is unlikely, but I will say it given the U.S. Treasury has been toying with small value buybacks recently and its the ""natural"" move). Option 2 is conditions deteriorate enough for the Fed to step in; perhaps another 15 to 25 bps rise if we take March 2020's peak to trough 54 to 118 bps at close as a guideline. (Though I would lean a bit higher unless we see metrics of treasury illiquidity strongly spike as well.)

SLR changes may help a bit by relaxing bank regulatory requirements and enabling them to absorb some of the Treasury selling, but fundamentally won't solve the long/short mismatch unless banks' treasury chooses to expand their long treasury holdings again, which seem unlikely. The Primary Dealer component of the bank likewise isn't going to want to take on the net duration risk being sold right now if markets risk unwinding. Likewise, it won't solve the issue of most savings flowing into MMFs, instead of banks, and who prefer short term government debt .

Likewise, to be clear it is probably just a matter of time until the Fed has to step in. The markets are already receiving an additional 600 billion in liquidity support (reserves) and shortfall in government issuance due to the debt ceiling. The TGA has already dumped 600 billion of reserves onto the market, and issued 600 billion less of T-Bills, adding significant liquidity to ON repo markets (although this can't fix demand mismatches and risk aversion + uncertainty). Once the debt ceiling ends and the Treasury aims to issue 600 additional T-Bills, we are likely to see some problems unless the Fed expands its balance sheet before then.

The biggest catalyst, however, is tax day coming up. The liquidity draw there is going to stress leveraged funds borrowing in repo and could be a catalyst similar to September 2019. Think next Monday will be ... quite the day ... with an even more exciting tax day on Tuesday. 300 bn+ in short liquidity will get drawn down, and that could hit remaining leveraged investors via their short borrowing pretty hard. (That said, unlike 2019 we have not seen any major warning signs on month/quarter end yet. Nonetheless even some repo rate volatility could increase tensions.)

TL;DR: The spike reflects an underlying lack of buyers in the market, and a potential mismatch between demand and supply of long term gov debt, and demand and supply for short term gov debt. If the mismatch is large, the Treasury market could spiral for liquidity reasons and disassociate from the path of rates, quickly driving rates higher.

Zoom in on March 2020, you can see the problem and should probably guess where the Fed stepped in.: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10)"

The US government has shown it's willing to create a world economic crisis on purpose, for absolutely no gains. It'd be different if a selfish story on the US side existed, but it doesn't: the tariffs are so brutal and haphazard that they only destroy, they don't even help the US itself.

The house of representatives isn't going to stop more nonsense like this. The supreme court seems very willing to let Trump do whatever he wants as well. The Senate by itself can't do anything. Then there's two forces left: the army and the people. I think the army isn't going to turn on all three branches of government. It might decide to enforce a supreme court decision against the executive, it might even decide to support congress, but all three branches being compromised makes it very very hard for the army to legitimize intervening.

Then there's the people of the US. I've seen a number of people argue that the American people will rise up if the country is actually being destroyed. Could the people, senate and army together save the republic? Possibly. Would that then also still save the US public debt? Unfortunately I don't think so. I think in such a situation the uncertainty of whether a new administration would honor the public debt would increase dramatically, and a default would perhaps be even more likely than today. But at least you'd still have another shot at democracy."

Credit agencies could also decide to downgrade making the risk free higher on all forms of debt across the world exacerbating the issue.

Separately the Trump tax cuts to me is a 100% non-starter, it will only add to a runaway budget deficit, if Trump and the Republicans pass it (which they have a good shot at passing), it’ll increase the deficit by nearly 30% and add 3 points to debt repayments immediately.

Fed will likely need to step in and start buying long term bonds to stabilize, but that is a form of monetary policy aka QE that has been out of favor due to its inflationary impact during COVID.

If any of these scenarios happen, in my opinion it’ll be BAD and the world will be measurably worse off and more destabilized for it."

However many potential scenarios we have seen before come back if rates rise another 1 percent or so (30 year at 6 percent)

1. Banks start experiencing losses on their treasury holdings.  That can lead to possible bank failures.
2. People start pulling their money out of smaller banks worried about bank failures.
3. Liquidity issues pop up as US treasuries become harder to trade for real cash.
4. Interest on the debt as a function of our budget continues to rise.  The only legislation even being talked about are tax cuts, which will only make things worse.  There has been no real spending cuts as yet.

Most importantly, I don’t think there is any help coming.  There is no way Congress will pass any bailouts.  The executive branch is being run by Fox News hosts and some incompetent billionaires.  The executive branch can’t actually execute anything given all the layoffs and stupid hires.  No TARP or PPP coming.

The Fed is the only hope who will be forced to make a terrible choice - let the markets crash or print 10 trillion to buy bonds and prop the market up, causing another inflation wave."

As I have faith in the Fed put if things get too out of hand, believe bonds and bond funds are relatively cheap right now due to the unwinding and inelastic supply. That said, implied volatility is high and it is a risky bet. The Fed may behave differently given inflation and the clear political cause; not sure if the Fed will ""bail out"" a politically forced crisis as readily as they responded to COVID.

I expect the Fed to have to step in eventually, but am unsure how much pain that will require.

In terms of profit, options are still looking expensive and haven't crunched the numbers. Would usually want exposure to the exact cusips with the highest deviation from the curve or to regions of the curve with unusually low liquidity. 

Personally though, think I would wait till Tuesday morning before making a clear move. Tax day could stress yields further, and early morning as the repo market finishes up (\~9:30 est) will be when I will see if anything makes sense to grab. 

(Though again, no guarantee here. And tbh, the gains are measure in a few % unless grabbing leverage. A big move for a safe asset, but small relative to upside of just having clean cash to buy stocks lower. Stocks may rally for a bit if the Fed steps in as well.

Likewise dollar depreciation throws a wrench into things; will the Fed provide long term yield liquidity if that may strengthen the sale off and move out of USD? It was one thing in 2020 when sellers wanted Dollars, it's another thing if they want out of USD.

That said, this isn't a good time for retail to play in the market; very easy to get burned. And, it isn't like most derivative traders are unaware of what I am saying. It is part of the price.)"

Valuations are also compressed by higher rates as CAPM models base any serious cashflow discount model on bond rates to measure how valuable an investment is (higher rates = lower valuations).   
  
A big gap between the short term rate and long term rate reflects poor investor confidence in inflation prospects or even in solvability. In this case I think it's both, investors are worried things could get crazy enough for US credit rating to drop substantially and inflation could spike up due to tarrifs leading to the increase in federal funds rate."

It's not that IEEPA explicitly says ""tariffs"". That's a simplistic view of the issue. It's that Congress has handed over a fairly broad set of its constitutionally allotted legislative powers to the executive under ""emergencies"" but in doing so it opens the door to the subjective assessment of any executive to determine *what* that ""emergency"" is. Whose to say it's not an emergency, Congress? Okay, then if Congress is going to have to decide if it's an emergency then the power might as well just reside with Congress. Even if a court orders this ""emergency"" is not an emergency, what's to stop an executive from trying again. Study any historical instances of a legislative body handing over emergency powers to an executive and you'll understand why the only real way out of this is Congress repealing IEEPA. Does ""et tu, Brute?"" ring a bell at all?

When the US was attacked in 1941, it took what, 24 hours for a special session of Congress to declare war? In a real emergency the action will be fairly clear and won't need much debate, in a non emergency there will be much dissent and that's the idea of a legislature, it prevents the whims of one individual and provides a state of general stability."

The fantasy is thinking this is country on country “warfare” and that two countries who are still allied to the USA are using a secret hack.

However, if you aren't familiar with options I would encourage you not to dip your foot in right now. A lot of retail investors are getting burned by shorting, options, Trump flip flops, misunderstanding implied volatility and option pricing, bid-ask spreads on options, etc.

As such what I wrote isn't investment advice, and not advice of a professional trader. Professional traders are on the other side of most options, so don't think we have some edge on them. It is risky, and the return isn't life changing due to high implied volatility on the contracts.

(Personally just playing around with some I made on February S&P (SPY) puts I got to cover against a senile slide. Almost all of my holdings are still cash looking for a good time to buy TIPS and buy back in. Dodging a 10% fall is enough; no need to be greedy.)"

They're talking on CNBC as if people on Reddit are actually squeezing silver. It's fucking absurd, they're practically encouraging it. 

They're like, ""Wow, these redditors are squeezing silver, how cool"" actually fucking encouraging it. 

Literally scum

Edit: Should have mentioned, it's literally fucking impossible to squeeze silver. It's not shorted at all. Hedge funds and Citadel hold lots of Long positions in it, not shorts. Buying it would be playing right into their hands.

Buying silver will make you likely lose money and absolutely give it to the hedge funds and Citadel.

By Silver, I mean $SLV, *I know nothing about phisical silver*. For anybody confused

Edit 2: If you bought $SLV months or years ago and made a profit, that's fantastic. This post is just saying that you should not buy silver right now.

Shorts on silver futures is arguably more transparent and can be seen on CBOE, CME, and other futures exchange websites.

Some forex & economic calender's will provide CFTC's report on net positions for gold, oil, and s&p 500 futures which can be used as a general market sentiment for a wide range of stock sectors not just commodities.

**update** obviously you can short squeeze silver, what are hedgers & speculators supposed to do when their shorts are nearing margin calls?  lol

**update2** yeah I'll admit there's **probably a coordinated effort into manipulating traders into buying silver thinking there will be a squeeze, don't believe it and probably the worst squeeze strategy**

SLV is owned and operated by Black Rock.

Guess who owns 13.2% of GME? Black Rock.

If this stock gets hyped it matters zero fucks.

The hedge funds are scared and they think the ""poors"" are all as easily manipulated as Facebook boomers that think memes are factual news.

So that's what they're doing. Mass misinformation/disinformation campaigns. They're using bots, probably paying real people to go around proclaiming ""hello fellow youths"" and whatever else.

Go and get a good broker, a broker who will charge you for its service. Otherwise you are not the customer, you are the product.

As the price of silver goes up so does production there's millions upon millions of tons of silver sitting in the ground and no one is mining it because it's not profitable right now.

If we were smart we would all buy mines stocks for silver mines.

Once the mind start going in production they are going to have stocks jump out of the ceiling.

You can't squeeze silver you just create more jobs and more production.

It's a 1.4 TRILLION USD commodity. GME only works because, after it's more than 10x growth, it's still only 17 Billion USD. Early this month it was 0.4 Billion. 

Retail investors can increase the price of half a billion. No one can move 1.4 Trillion."

I'm not suprised, most silver ""stackers"" are literally the worst investors I know and will gladly pay thrice market value for a ""limited mint"" or whatever else they believe will make them rich.

On the other hand tbh, I do buy bullion, as a hedge and market failsafe for the fun, having something real is just cool. And both silver and gold bullion have  made me good money the last year.

Silver stocks on the other hand are just retarded. Why buy stock if you can buy the real thing? Also that market is completely inflated and controlled by the assholes we're fighting. There's almost double the silver stock than there is silver, which makes it even more logical to buy bullion instead."

It’s also pretty stupid to call out SLV when it’s actually a reasonable play when you think about: inflation (40% of all USD in circulation was printed in the last year), low output from silver mines, silver is used heavily in solar panels and EVs. 

Idc if any of you buy silver I’m just pointing out your blatant double standard and lack of research. It’s easy to scream “hedge fund bot” and then shill your AMC which Citadel is straddling."

That said, the boomers WILL put money in silver/gold until the volatility calms down so it's not necessarily a bad play.

By that I mean years and decades. Silver like gold acts as a hedge to volatility and uncertainty in the market. IT IS NOT A STOCK TO PUMP/SQUEEZE. You hold it to safe guard against a fucked up market like 2008. That’s why silver dropped and was cheap as fuck from 2011 since the market was in a bull run. 

And it’s long term specifically for this reason- silver is used in all kinds of electronics, specially batteries because it’s the best conductor of electricity. With the increase of green policies around the world and a move towards electric cars and other battery storage systems the use of silver is going to increase and the quantity being produced is reducing. Reducing but not by a lot to cause a long term shortage or a squeeze. So if you wanna get into silver get ready to hold for years and maybe decades."

They’re in the biotech space and are working in regenerative medicine and peptide therapies, with the goal of helping people live longer and healthier lives. I haven’t seen much discussion about them here yet, so thought I’d put this on the radar and see if anyone else has been following them.

What stood out to me is the people behind the company. Their board includes some well-known scientists and professionals who’ve been involved in major advances in medicine and biotech. The leadership team also seems to have experience launching and scaling companies focused on health tech. From what I could gather, they’re heavily focused on peptide-based treatments and long-term healthspan strategies.

Curious if anyone here has looked deeper into Vesalius? Would love to hear thoughts, especially if you’ve been following their research or business moves more closely."

Basically, this means Crown is teaming up with the country’s biggest gas marketplace to bring in more fuel and make it easier for people and businesses across India to access it. India wants 15% of its energy from natural gas by 2030, and this deal puts Crown in a good spot to help make that happen while growing its business in a fast-developing economy that’s hungry for reliable, cleaner energy.

Highlighted Main Points

Crown LNG signed a non-binding MOU with India Gas Exchange to collaborate on LNG sales via its Kakinada terminal project.

The partnership supports India’s goal to boost natural gas usage to 15% of its energy mix by 2030.

Crown will have improved access to Indian gas markets through IGX’s platform, increasing reach to producers, traders, and offtakers.

TLDR

Crown LNG teamed up with India’s top gas exchange to make natural gas easier to sell and distribute across the country."

 The S&P futures price is an indication of market sentiment and investor expectations about the future direction of the stock market. A higher S&P futures price generally indicates optimism in the stock market, suggesting that investors expect the stock market to rise in the future. Conversely, a lower S&P futures price may indicate pessimism and suggest that the stock market may see a decline. However, it is important to note that the S&P futures price is only one of many indicators used to predict the stock market activity, and it's not always accurate as it depends on various factors that can influence the market."

From higher consumer prices to strained supply chains, these short-sighted policies are hurting everyday Americans.

But we don’t have to sit by and watch.

One powerful way to show discontent with these reckless decisions?
Invest in Chinese markets.

By purchasing shares in strong, innovative Chinese companies, you’re not just making a smart financial move — you’re sending a message:
You support economic cooperation, not economic sabotage.
You believe in global growth, not political games.

China continues to lead in sectors like tech, green energy, and manufacturing. As the U.S. government undermines its own economy with trade wars and inflationary pressure, China remains a stable, high-potential investment opportunity.

Invest with purpose. Let your portfolio speak.

A higher S&P futures price generally indicates optimism in the stock market, suggesting that investors expect the stock market to rise in the future. Conversely, a lower S&P futures price may indicate pessimism and suggest that the stock market may see a decline.

**⬆︎54.91% Mesa Air**

**Two regional airlines are joining forces. Mesa, which flies mostly in the West, is merging with Republic, which serves the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. The new company will run over 1,200 daily flights and take on a new name, Republic Airways Holdings. Mesa’s debt will be wiped as part of the deal. (**[**Financial Post**](https://financialpost.com/pmn/regional-airlines-republic-airways-mesa-air-group-are-combining-in-an-all-stock-deal)**)**



**⬆︎16.22% U.S. Steel**

**The Trump administration announced a new review of the steelmaker’s planned sale to Japan’s Nippon Steel. The $55-a-share deal, nearly a 50% premium as of yesterday, was blocked under Biden over national security concerns. Now, activist investor Ancora wants a new board in place to help push it through. (**[**Barron’s**](https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-steel-activist-nippon-85daee39)**)**



**⬆︎7.83% Dollar Tree**

**The discount retail chain just got upgraded from ""Neutral"" to ""Buy"" by Citi’s analysts. With tariffs raising costs on about half its products, analysts believe the company can bump prices from $1.25 to $1.75 without losing shoppers. (**[**Yahoo**](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/why-dollar-tree-dltr-stock-152142999.html)**)**



# Stock losers



⬇︎**2.82%** **Shell**

**The British oil and gas giant cut its expectations for natural gas and liquefied natural gas production this quarter**, due to bad weather and unplanned maintenance in Australia. The company recently reaffirmed its focus on oil and gas, scaling back on green energy spending to boost profitability. A move welcomed by investors but criticized by climate advocates. ([euronews](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/04/07/shell-cuts-gas-production-outlook-due-to-maintenance-and-bad-weather))



⬇︎**13.22%** **Hang Seng Index**

**The worst single-day crash for Hong Kong shares since the 1997 Asian financial crisis.** The Hang Seng Index, which tracks major Chinese stocks, plunged after markets opened Monday, reacting to China’s 34% retaliatory tariffs announced after Friday’s Hong Kong market close. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/business/china-us-tariffs-retaliation-hnk-intl/index.html))

Potential for Transformational M&A:

Given the backgrounds of both CEO Emil Assemtato and Director Craig Marshak, there is strong speculation that $TWOH could pursue a merger or acquisition involving a Nasdaq-sized business. Such a move would aim to transform the OTC shell into a platform capable of an uplisting to a major exchange—potentially marking one of the biggest mergers in the OTC space in 2025. Strategic Positioning:

With the leadership team’s extensive experience in turning small-cap and penny stocks into significant market players, $TWOH is positioning itself to capitalize on merger/acquisition opportunities that could unlock substantial value for shareholders."

A higher S&P futures price generally indicates optimism in the stock market, suggesting that investors expect the stock market to rise in the future. Conversely, a lower S&P futures price may indicate pessimism and suggest that the stock market may see a decline.

Up slightly in this schizophrenic market.  I wanted to ask you - does this fund generally follow the performance of the 3 Main U.S. indices?  I know real estate has its own (DJUSRE), but I wasn't sure if it interplayed with that or generally the performance of the 3 Main indices.

Alos, do you know if the Divi's on this fund are qualified or unqualified.  Or mixed?  I was trying to read the prospectus on my phone : (  to get this info...but I didn't see anything that specifically mentioned.  Thanks."

 Esentially the bubble is huge, no one is buying, inventory is up, average income over average home price is higher than 2008.  Majority of ppl i know in thier  20s and 30s live with family.  If there is a recession or if policy changes that makes people give up thier empty investment properties theyre sitting on (end to the morgage interest write off) its basically a sure thing.

If you think this is a bad idea or have any advice, lmk why and if I should invest in something else like some crypto.

•Current market cap $5M (at the time of writing this)

•iDreamCTV & WhaleTV partnership going live this month (on 41M+ smart TVs) 

•TV/Movie streaming business model like TUBI, HULU, NFLX, PARA, FUBO, DIS 

•Closing on $11M acquisition, going on the balance sheet

•(2) Schedule 13-G filers past February owning more than 5% of the company’s common stock 

•iDreamCTV generates revenue through commercial ads similar to TUBI, PlutoTV, Freeve and other free TV streaming platforms

•iDreamCTV app currently available on Smart TVs using the ROKU operating system. I tested out on my ROKU TV and I can confirm the app works well and they have advertisers with commercial ad breaks running on their channels 

•$2M debt reduction

•Former SONY Music senior vice president of Merchandising, Howard Lau joined AHRO's advisory board last year

•Nearly maxed out O/S, no room for dilution 

•Audited & Fully SEC reporting company 

AHRO has other business divisions as well. The TV streaming one caught my interest the most.

Here's a little more detail. AHRO's iDreamCTV partnership with WhaleTV going live this month (April) according to the company in a recent press release dated 3/6/2025. WhaleTV is a tv operating system that powers 41M+ active smart TVs. This is huge for AHRO iDreamCTV as it markets them right next to giant streaming apps like Netflix, FUBO, Paramount+. Disney+ on smartTVs that’s powered by the WhaleTV operating system (Over 41M active Smart TVs)

AHRO’s iDreamCTV is a TV streaming app which generates revenue though commercial ads similar to TUBI, Freeve, PlutoTV, and other streaming platforms. The partnership with ZEASN/WhaleTV is a huge catalyst as it would skyrocket the number of people using the iDreamCTV app and revenue that they generate through ads

post,2025-04-02 09:52:23,1jpkson,stockstobuytoday,"RXRX: Biotech? Great, forget it. It's all about Techbio now",Ill-Employer-4020,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/1jpkson/rxrx_biotech_great_forget_it_its_all_about/,6,0.0,1.0,"Let me tell you a short story before your attention span wears off

In 2004, Amazon Web Services launched with no clear revenue model and minimal public understanding. Analysts dismissed it as “an online bookstore trying to sell cloud space.” Quietly, AWS built the infrastructure layer of the internet. Today? It underpins trillions in enterprise value

Now imagine that playbook applied to drug discovery. That’s Recursion Pharmaceuticals

Trading at $5.30/share with a $2.3B market cap, most investors still think RXRX is just another cash burning clinical stage biotech with AI sprinkled in. It’s not. RXRX is building the infrastructure layer of pharma, a vertically integrated, AI native drug discovery platform with the potential to change how medicine is developed, tested, and brought to market

Forget your gambling fueled Biotech pics. It’s not a bet on one molecule. It’s a bet on a scalable drug discovery engine. Think the intersection of OpenAI, Moderna, and AWS

# So what are the core drivers of this misunderstood TechBio?

\- Recursion OS + BioHive-2: Their full stack discovery engine runs on the largest Nvidia powered supercomputer in the pharmaceutical industry. Over 3 trillion in silico compound-cell interactions simulated to date. No other pharma company is operating on this scale. Not even close

\- 23+ Petabyte Proprietary Dataset: Phenotypic, cellular, molecular, compound-response data, the kind that takes decades to replicate. This is a moat you can’t copy paste

\- 15+ Clinical & Preclinical Assets: These are not the product, but the proof. Each candidate is a byproduct of a recursive AI system. Like Google Search, every result improves the next one. The ""15"" is not the limit, nor the number one should pay attention too. It's the evidence that what RXRX is doing, works

\- Recursive Flywheel: Their platform learns from every experiment. AI/ML models are updated using automated wet-lab robotics and cell imaging feedback loops. This self reinforcing learning cycle compounds over time, faster than traditional R&D

\- $20B+ Milestone Optionality: Through partnerships with Roche, Bayer, Merck, and Sanofi, RXRX has already proven platform utility. Roche paid $30M for a single phenomap. And there’s a pipeline of dozens more ready to be monetized

\- Exscientia Acquisition: Expanded Recursion’s chemistry design stack and deepened its AI talent pool. Now they span everything from LLM-based molecule generation to automated small molecule synthesis

# Ok, but your concerned about the valuation? You’re looking through the wrong lens

Yes, RXRX burns $500M/year. But traditional valuation models break here, and they should. This is not a linear biotech play. This is pre monetized infrastructure. Trying to DCF RXRX today is like valuing Nvidia in 2015 or Uber in 2011 before the optionality was even visible

Listen:

If Recursion OS becomes the standard backbone of AI drug discovery, you're looking at AWS-level margins. If phenomaps become the industry standard and are licensed like APIs? SaaS-style recurring revenue. If just one rare disease drug (e.g. REC-994) reaches commercialization? That’s a $1B–$5B+ market, high-margin tailwind over a decade

Some of us have been burned by biotech. It has a bad rep. It's too binary. Too volatile. Too opaque

Good news for you, RXRX is not a biotech. It's engineered to flip the model on its head. It’s non binary. Non linear. Platform first. It’s a self-reinforcing techbio platform, validated by **Nvidia, Blackrock, SoftBank, Novo Holdings, Baillie Gifford, the UAE’s SFW**, **and four of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies**

You don’t buy RXRX for its 2024 revenue. You buy it because it will be the next infrastructure layer of pharma. AWS wasn’t built for book sales. And RXRX isn’t built for a single drug

Remember people, the best investments aren’t in trends, they’re in infrastructure that makes trends inevitable

Thank me in a decade and Godspeed"

A higher S&P futures price generally indicates optimism in the stock market, suggesting that investors expect the stock market to rise in the future. Conversely, a lower S&P futures price may indicate pessimism and suggest that the stock market may see a decline.

**⬆︎735.10% Newsmax**

**Going public isn’t usually this dramatic—but Newsmax isn’t your typical cable network. The conservative channel priced its IPO at $10 today, then popped as investors piled in. Only 7.5 million shares were available to trade. Newsmax is now the fourth most-watched cable news channel in the U.S. (**[**CNBC**](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/31/newsmax-stock-starts-trading-on-nyse.html)**)**



**⬆︎109.08% Corcept Therapeutics**

**A new pill could bring hope to ovarian cancer patients. Corcept’s experimental treatment slowed disease progression by 30% in a late-stage trial for patients with a specific tumor type. It’s aimed at those who haven’t responded to other treatments, and the company plans to seek FDA approval later this year. (**[**Fierce Biotech**](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/corcepts-investigational-oral-therapy-cuts-ovarian-cancer-progression-30-teeing-fda-filing)**)**



**⬆︎14.46% Mr. Cooper**

**Mortgage giant Rocket is buying its smaller rival Mr. Cooper for $9.4 billion in cash, paying a 40% premium. The deal could also help Rocket save up to $400 million by streamlining costs and tech. With more homes for sale and mortgage rates dipping, buyers are returning to the market. (**[**New York Post**](https://nypost.com/2025/03/31/business/rocket-to-buy-home-loan-service-provider-mr-cooper-in-9-4b-deal/)**)**



# Stock losers



⬇︎**7.30%** **CoreWeave**

**The Nvidia-backed AI cloud company went public on Friday, but the excitement faded fast.** Investors grew wary of its $13B debt, dependence on a few big clients like Microsoft and aging Nvidia chips, which could lose value soon with newer models already rolling out. ([TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:d15250b9a094b:0-coreweave-stock-drops-10-on-second-day-as-economic-concerns-debt-and-ipo-timing-weigh-on-investors/))



⬇︎**8.90%** **Moderna**

**Biotech stocks were hammered after top FDA official Dr. Peter Marks suddenly resigned.** He played a key role in approving vaccines and rare-disease drugs, and investors now fear his replacement may not be as supportive—especially with growing influence from vaccine-skeptic officials in the Trump administration. ([Barron’s](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fda-resignation-peter-marks-biotech-stocks-9a19c2cb))

* The war in Ukraine taught Europeans that the current wars are drone wars. You need drone defence to defend cheaply against drones. Otherwise, you will shoot 100k USD rockets against 1K USD drones.
* EOS, an Australian defence company, excels in anti-drone technology, killing drones with bullets and lasers. With most of its capitalization in cash and no debt, it is positioning itself for substantial growth.
* The company has a robust A$2 billion contract pipeline, including advanced negotiations for major deals. Each of those should significantly boost its market capitalization.
* EOS's innovative products, like the Slinger and R500, offer unmatched accuracy and efficiency in drone defence, making it a key player in modern warfare.
* With a strong financial position and a high potential for contract wins, EOS presents a high-upside investment opportunity with limited downside risk.

 The S&P futures price is an indication of market sentiment and investor expectations about the future direction of the stock market. A higher S&P futures price generally indicates optimism in the stock market, suggesting that investors expect the stock market to rise in the future. Conversely, a lower S&P futures price may indicate pessimism and suggest that the stock market may see a decline. However, it is important to note that the S&P futures price is only one of many indicators used to predict the stock market activity, and it's not always accurate as it depends on various factors that can influence the market."

**⬆︎37.61% Soleno**

**The FDA approved a new drug that treats constant hunger caused by a rare condition called Prader-Willi syndrome. The approval wasn’t easy; Soleno had to prove the drug worked by taking patients off it and showing their hunger came back. (**[**IBD**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stock-soleno-therapeutics-prader-willi-approval/)**)**



**⬆︎20.49% Avis Budget**

**Trump’s new auto tariffs could push new car prices higher, which is good news for rental companies like Hertz and Avis. Their cars are already in the U.S., so they won’t get hit with the extra costs when it’s time to sell them. As buyers turn to used cars instead, those rental fleets suddenly look a lot more valuable. (**[**Fast Company**](https://www.fastcompany.com/91307147/hertz-avis-htz-stock-surges-rental-used-car-prices-benefit-from-trump-auto-tariffs)**)**



**⬆︎7.60% Rivian**

**The EV maker is spinning off its e-bike and scooter efforts into a new company called Also. The move lets Rivian stay focused on its main electric trucks and SUVs, while Also takes on the growing market for smaller electric vehicles. (**[**Business Wire**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250326599387/en/Rivian-Spins-out-Micromobility-Business-into-New-StartupAlso-Inc.)**)**



# Stock losers



⬇︎**3.21%** **AMD**

**A Jefferies analyst said the company is falling behind in the race to power artificial intelligence.** Tests showed AMD’s AI chips don’t perform as well as Nvidia’s older models, and the analyst warned that Nvidia’s lead is only going to grow with its next-generation chips. ([IBD](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-downgraded-lags-nvidia-in-ai/))



⬇︎**7.36%** **General Motors**

**Trump’s new 25% auto tariffs are shaking up the car industry, and some carmakers are hit harder than others.** Tesla and Ford look mostly safe since they build a lot in the U.S., though Ford still brings in some parts. GM could take the biggest hit, with more of its cars made in Mexico. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/27/gm-stock-trump-auto-tariffs.html))



⬇︎**9.88%** **Jefferies**

**🛎️ Earnings report - Speaking of the devil. Well, AMD’s devil.** The investment bank said tough market conditions and uncertainty around trade and global events made things harder last quarter, with fewer big deals like IPOs and mergers hurting results. ([Baystreet.ca](https://www.baystreet.ca/articles/techinsider.aspx?id=4939))



⬇︎**20.12%** **Applovin**

**Short seller Muddy Waters accused the mobile advertising platform of inflating its growth by mostly targeting repeat customers instead of bringing in new ones.** It also accused it of breaking platform rules by collecting user data in questionable ways. ([Wall Street Pit](https://wallstreetpit.com/125561-applovin-stock-takes-a-hit-after-muddy-waters-short-call/))

**⬆︎11.65% GameStop**

**🛎️ Earnings report - GameStop knows what its investors want. CEO Ryan Cohen’s latest move to revive the struggling video game retailer is putting its $4.8 billion cash reserve into Bitcoin—following in MicroStrategy’s footsteps. (**[**CNBC**](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/25/gamestop-says-it-will-add-bitcoin-as-a-treasury-reserve-asset.html)**)**



**⬆︎5.25% Nintendo**

**Rumors are flying that the video game company could launch the Switch 2 as soon as June. It’s the updated version of its hugely successful Switch console, first released in 2017. Some reports say a full reveal could happen as early as next week, and investors are expecting big sales. (**[**Sherwood**](https://sherwood.news/tech/nintendo-shares-soar-as-buzz-builds-amongst-gamers-and-goldman-sachs/)**)**



**⬆︎3.08% Dollar Tree**

**🛎️ Earnings report - The discount retail chain is selling off Family Dollar for $1 billion, nearly a decade after buying it for $9 billion. The chain never quite fit in and struggled to compete with bigger players. Investors seem relieved to see Dollar Tree cut its losses and refocus on its core brand.

post,2025-03-26 19:05:49,1jkjsdn,stockstobuytoday,"LASR: The Future is Bright, Quite Literally",Neowwwwww,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/1jkjsdn/lasr_the_future_is_bright_quite_literally/,1,0.0,1.0,"
When I think about the future, my mind races to visions of space travel, flying cars, lightsabers, and laser beams—not to mention robots as ubiquitous as R2-D2 and C-3PO, making our lives better by taking care of menial tasks. But this isn’t about robots; today, it’s all about lasers.  

Lasers have existed in some form for ages—since the dawn of human ingenuity, really. Picture early humans discovering how to focus sunlight using glass formed from melted sand (thanks to lightning strikes) to create a makeshift laser for starting fires. At its core, a laser is simply focused light, often used to generate extreme heat. It might sound simple, but the heat is powerful enough to melt metal—and over time, lasers have transformed countless industries.  

Industrial-grade lasers are versatile tools, capable of cutting through materials like metal, wood, and plastic—basically anything that doesn’t reflect light too well. From manufacturing to inspection, lasers are integral to almost every step of production. The industrial laser industry is well-established and widely known, so you might wonder, “Why should I care? Isn’t this all priced in already?”  

Well, you’re right—most of it is. But one rapidly evolving aspect of the laser industry is flying under the radar: the use of lasers in military defense as weapons.  

---

### Lasers in Defense: Science Fiction Meets Reality  

You may have seen a photo making the rounds a few years ago, showing the Navy testing a high-powered laser. Lasers are improving every day, and companies like nLIGHT have been at the forefront of the industry. Since its founding in 2000, nLIGHT has mastered industrial lasers, but in 2021, it ventured into defense contracts. Backed by decades of experience, the defense segment of its business already boasts a $150 million backlog ([source](https://www.nlight.net/directed-energy)).  

It’s fascinating to speculate about the military applications of lasers. Seriously—stop for a moment and think about it. What might they be used for?  

Here’s what I came up with:  
- Space Force satellites armed with lasers to take out enemy satellites—literally James Bond-level stuff.  
- Laser guns, like something out of *Star Wars*.  
- Laser-equipped tanks.  
- Anti-intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) defense systems.  
- Anti-drone systems.  

Of course, there are challenges. Lasers, for all their potential, face limitations. For example, due to Earth’s curvature, ground-based lasers are restricted in range. Unlike missiles, which follow a trajectory, lasers travel in a straight line—at the speed of light, no less. This means line of sight is essential for them to function as weapons.  

Missile defense systems, for instance, would need a direct line of sight to the missile they’re targeting. The math for calculating trajectories isn’t the problem—heck, you could build a Raspberry Pi system at home that tracks and targets objects. The real issues lie elsewhere:  
- Maximum range (e.g., about 3 miles at sea level).  
- Energy requirements (cooling systems and operation demand massive amounts of power).  
- Line of sight.  
- Calibration challenges.  
- Effective range in space.  

---

### Potential Solutions and Challenges  

Stationary laser systems seem like a logical solution. However, protecting the entirety of U.S. borders would be prohibitively expensive. For reference, Israel’s Iron Dome is successful in part because of the country’s compact size. In the U.S., it would make more sense to safeguard key locations like Washington, D.C., New York City, and critical coastal military bases.  

Currently, the military is testing 50-kilowatt lasers mounted on Stryker vehicles ([source](https://breakingdefense.com/2024/05/army-soldiers-not-impressed-with-strykers-outfitted-with-50-kilowatt-lasers-service-official-says/)). These lasers, weighing about 3,000 pounds, struggle with dust and particulates that reduce their range. However, the Navy has seen significant success with laser systems mounted on ships.  

And what about lasers in space? Satellites with laser weaponry are a thrilling concept, but energy remains a major hurdle. A 50-kilowatt laser demands substantial power and cooling—but with space’s frigid temperatures, cooling might not pose the same issue. Could this allow lasers to achieve their full range potential?  

---

### The Future of Warfare  

Think about this: in the 1950s, guided missiles were science fiction, and drones didn’t exist. Seventy-five years later, we have missiles that can be launched by individuals and drones that fit in the palm of your hand. Technology evolves rapidly, and lasers are poised to revolutionize warfare.  

Just as drones transformed aerial combat, lasers could reshape the battlefield. Instead of a million-dollar rocket to destroy a $300 drone, a $4 laser beam could do the job. With companies like nLIGHT leading the charge, the future of lasers looks undeniably bright. "

# Hidden Gem Defence Stock

I play the European defence through **Electro Optic Systems:**

* The war in Ukraine taught Europeans that the current wars are drone wars. You need drone defence to defend cheaply against drones. Otherwise, you will shoot 100k USD rockets against 1K USD drones.
* EOS, an Australian defence company, excels in **anti-drone technology,** **killing drones with bullets and lasers.** With **55% capitalization in cash** and **no debt,** it is positioning itself for substantial growth.
* The company has a robust **A$2 billion contract pipeline**, including advanced negotiations for major deals. Each of those should significantly boost its market capitalization.
* EOS's innovative products, like the Slinger and R500, offer unmatched accuracy and efficiency in drone defence, making it a key player in modern warfare.
* With a strong financial position and a high potential for contract wins, EOS presents a high-upside investment opportunity with limited downside risk.

The chipmaker has been a phenomenon, riding the surging demand for its artificial intelligence-empowering chips. The stock has jumped 180 per cent this year, fuelling about a fifth of the S&P 500’s gains in the process. But trading volume in Nvidia has slowed in recent months with the average number of shares changing hands down 40 per cent from the first half of the year. 

And over the past six months, its shares are up just 3 per cent compared with more than 11 per cent for the S&P 500. In the last month, Nvidia shares have actually fallen about 9 per cent. The retreat may simply be year-end profit-taking but it comes as investors consider how the developments in AI will play out in 2025 — probably one of the biggest new year calls they have to make given how important the technology is in driving returns.

As Nvidia ($NVDA) soars, the spotlight on AI-related stocks intensifies. But the AI revolution isn't over yet—there's more potential in companies like $AIFU. With a focus on AI innovation and strategic growth, $AIFU is poised to capitalize on the growing demand for AI solutions.

It has a backlog of future projects lined up and is starting to play a bigger role in national security space work. (**[**MarketWatch**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/intuitive-machines-latest-moon-landing-may-have-run-into-trouble-but-backlog-points-to-upside-ahead-a44d8fb3)**)**



**⬆︎17.34% IonQ**

**CEO Peter Chapman hit the media circuit to push back on doubts about how far off quantum computing really is. He said it’s not decades away, but just a few years from shaking up modern tech—and that instead of convincing people, IonQ should focus on delivering a breakthrough moment, like AI did with ChatGPT. (**[**Nasdaq**](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-ionq-stock-skyrocketing-today-1)**)**



**⬆︎11.93% Tesla**

**The EV maker led the “Magnificent Seven” with its biggest jump since Election Day, bouncing back after a rough few weeks. The stock had been sliding on worries about slowing sales and growing backlash over Elon Musk’s politics. Monday’s rally suggests some investors might be buying the dip.

**The retail and payments software company lowered its revenue forecast**, blaming inflation, job worries, and low consumer confidence for slower store sales and fewer small business sign-ups. ([BetaKit](https://betakit.com/lightspeed-scales-back-fiscal-2025-revenue-outlook-as-several-macroeconomic-conditions-have-deteriorated/))



⬇︎**6.94%** **Bayer**

**A U.S. jury hit the German drug giant with a massive $2.1 billion verdict over its Roundup weed killer**, saying the company failed to warn users it could cause cancer. Bayer’s been fighting Roundup lawsuits for years, but the size of this latest ruling spooked investors. ([Anadolu Ajansı](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/german-drug-giant-bayers-stock-falls-8-after-21b-fine-from-us-jury/3518941))



⬇︎**17.18%** **James Hardie**

**The building materials maker is making a big bet on the U.S. housing market with its deal to buy Chicago-based home-decking provider AZEK**, but investors aren’t so sure it’s the right place or the right time. Concerns about the shaky U.S. economy and rising risks overshadowed the company’s long-term growth pitch. James Hardie is Australian-founded but earns about 75% of its revenue in North America.

The company’s eVTOL aircraft are getting a lot of attention, and for good reason. They just teamed up with Palantir Technologies, which is a game-changer. Using Palantir’s AI-powered tools, Archer is aiming to optimize manufacturing, enhance air traffic management, and set new standards for safety and efficiency in aviation. This partnership gives Archer a huge technological edge, not to mention the potential for military applications given Palantir’s strong ties to defense.  
  
Even though Archer's not yet profitable, they've got a solid financial foundation with a strong cash position, and analysts are optimistic about the company’s trajectory. The growth potential is clear, especially as they keep pushing toward regulatory approvals and working on pilot training for their air taxis. Plus, the stock has been climbing, jumping 16% after the Palantir news. With a price target suggesting another 40% upside, is there plenty more runway ahead?

 The S&P futures price is an indication of market sentiment and investor expectations about the future direction of the stock market. A higher S&P futures price generally indicates optimism in the stock market, suggesting that investors expect the stock market to rise in the future. Conversely, a lower S&P futures price may indicate pessimism and suggest that the stock market may see a decline. However, it is important to note that the S&P futures price is only one of many indicators used to predict the stock market activity, and it's not always accurate as it depends on various factors that can influence the market."

In this case, the backstop agreement is related to the proposed business combination between Aesther Healthcare Acquisition Corp and Ocean Biomedical. The first backstop agreement, announced in September 2022, provided up to $40 million in support for the merger. The execution of a second backstop agreement increases the total amount of financial support available to $80 million.

This announcement is significant because it provides additional financial support for the proposed merger between Aesther Healthcare Acquisition Corp and Ocean Biomedical. The added support is intended to increase the chances of the merger being successfully completed. The execution of the second backstop agreement also indicates that the parties involved are confident about the future prospects of the combined company.

So, I was doing some reading up on healthcare innovations because, and I stumbled upon this article for CEL-SCI. Their research on rheumatoid arthritis treatment got me intrigued because it's not every day you hear about potential game-changers in the medical field.

Would love to hear some insights from people who’ve been following them for a while.

CEL-SCI looks like it's onto something big with their LEAPS technology, especially in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Unlike traditional meds that suppress the immune system, their approach with CEL-4000 aims to rebalance it, targeting RA without compromising our body's defenses against other threats like infections or cancer. It reshapes how we fight autoimmune diseases altogether.

&#x200B;

**Main Bits:**

* Current RA treatments mainly involve suppressing the immune system, which can have drawbacks like leaving patients vulnerable to infections and cancer.
* CEL-SCI's LEAPS technology, particularly CEL-4000, offers a fresh approach by rebalancing the immune system to target RA specifically while preserving its ability to fight off other threats.
* The article suggests using adaptive study designs and disease-related biomarkers in clinical trials, potentially revolutionizing how we approach treatment in autoimmune diseases.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** CEl-SCI’s new tech seems exciting, would love to get your thoughts on it."

1. **Resource Increase**: They've reported a significant boost in their resources - about 3.29 million tonnes at 6.4% graphitic carbon (Cg) and an additional 1.43 million tonnes at 7.4% Cg.
2. **Extended Mine Life**: This increase could potentially extend the mine's life by at least 8 years, a big deal since LDI is North America's only graphite-producing mine.
3. **Ramping Up Production**: To meet rising demand, they're planning to operate seven days a week starting Q2 this year, aiming for a 25,000-tonnes-per-year capacity.
4. **Future Outlook**: The CEO seems pretty optimistic about their position in the growing market, especially with the rise in electric vehicle manufacturing.

Anyway:

Here's a quick rundown on the current graphite market situation and Northern Graphite:

1. **China's Market Moves**: China, the world's largest graphite producer, has reinstated subsidies for domestic EVs, reducing graphite exports. Additionally, they plan to impose export controls on certain graphite exports starting December 1. This is significant as graphite is vital for EV batteries and industrial uses.
2. **Northern Graphite's Response**: Northern Graphite, the only graphite producer in North America, reported a sales volume increase of over 28% in Q3 2023 compared to Q2.
3. **Company Focus**: Northern Graphite, listed on the TSX Venture Exchange, focuses on producing natural graphite and upgrading it for use in green economy products, including EV battery materials and fuel cells."

It's happening online on Jan 18, 2024.

Matt Sherwood from The Economist Intelligence Unit will also be discussing the graphite market's current state and the impacts of China's export controls. As well as Northern Graphite's CEO, Hugues Jacquemin, talking about their strategy from mining to market to battery.

As North America's sole graphite producer, Northern Graphite seems primed to be a significant player, especially with the growing demand from North American automakers and battery manufacturers. Figured I'd drop it here if anyone else is interested in the graphite industry or Northern graphite!!

Calidi is pioneering a new generation of targeted immunotherapies aimed at combating solid tumors and teaching the immune system to seek out and destroy cancer cells throughout the body.

**A Closer Look at Calidi's Breakthrough:**

Calidi's mission revolves around transforming ""cold"" tumors, which evade the immune system, into ""hot"" tumors that immune cells can effectively attack and eliminate. Leveraging advanced allogeneic stem cell technologies along with engineered viruses like vaccinia and adenovirus, Calidi's platforms aim to revolutionize cancer treatment by empowering the immune system to recognize and eradicate cancer cells.

**A Brief Overview of Calidi's Journey:**

Founded in 2014 and headquartered in San Diego, California, Calidi Biotherapeutics has been at the forefront of cutting-edge research and innovation in oncology. With its foundational patents dating back to 2015, Calidi has continuously expanded its portfolio, culminating in the acquisition of a subsidiary in Germany and the exclusive licensing of the NeuroNova technology from Northwestern University and the City of Hope in 2021.

**Seeking More Insights:**

As we delve deeper into Calidi's developments, I'm curious to hear if anyone has additional insights or thoughts on the company's trajectory.

They've secured $3 million from Sprott Resource Streaming and Royalty Corp., split into $1 million in secured debt and $2 million in royalty financing. This builds on their previous agreement from last year for their Quebec and Namibia mines.

Key points: They've increased their total loan from Sprott to about $14.6 million, including capitalized interest. Also, they've sold an additional 4% revenue royalty from their Quebec mine.

It looks like Northern is shoring up funds, possibly good news for their operational capacity. But, as always, more debt and royalties could impact future profits. Let's keep a close eye on how this plays out. Thoughts?"

She insisted on buying a supply of Flow water, the ones in those distinctive cardboard boxes. I was initially skeptical due to the cost, but I must admit it was quite impressive. This got me thinking that Flow must be raking in substantial profits if they can convince consumers like my wife to stock up on their product. To my surprise, After I got home I did some DD on the brand and discovered that Flow is actually a publicly traded company listed as $FLOW.TO.

What's even more intriguing is that I stumbled upon one of their recent press releases announcing a partnership with Live Nation to distribute their water at major concert venues. This is undoubtedly a significant move for them, and I'm looking forward to seeing Flow water available at events like the upcoming Drake concert in October.

I found it amusing that my wife's favorite water brand is publicly traded. Has anyone else ever come across a product they or their loved ones enjoy and then discovered it's a publicly traded company?

* **Russell Lake Project**: They're gearing up for a 5,000-metre diamond drilling program over the next few months. This is quite a large-scale operation, considering it'll cover ten to twelve holes. What's more, this project is strategically located near Cameco's McArthur River Uranium Mine.
* **Moore Uranium Project**: After wrapping up at Russell Lake, they're planning to drill an additional 3,000 meters in eight to ten holes at their wholly-owned Moore Project. The focus here is on high-grade uranium, which is pretty intriguing.

The combined drill campaign across both projects totals 8,000 metres and is fully funded. The company seems confident in the discovery potential at both sites, especially given the high-grade mineralization in historical drill holes."

Anixa Bioscience is working on a breast cancer vaccine that targets a protein called α-lactalbumin. This protein is normally inactive post-lactation but is found in most TNBC tumors. The vaccine aims to trigger the immune system to recognize and combat cells expressing this protein, potentially stopping TNBC tumors before they grow.

The significance here is two-fold. First, TNBC is known for higher recurrence rates and accounts for a larger percentage of breast cancer deaths, despite being less common overall. Second, this approach represents a shift towards preemptive, immune-based strategies in cancer treatment. The technology, originally developed by Dr. Vincent Tuohy at Cleveland Clinic, is now being pursued by Anixa . It's a novel direction in oncology, especially for a cancer type that has limited treatment options. Anyone else have insights into these guys?

Would love some insight on them from the community!

**Who Are They?**

Nocera, Inc. and its affiliates specialize in creating and manufacturing recirculation aquaculture systems for fish farming operations in Taiwan. Additionally, the company undertakes the construction, management, and operation of aquaculture facilities, and offers consulting, technology transfer, and aquaculture project management services to new and existing aquaculture management businesses. They were founded in 2014 and have headquarters in Taiwan. They currently have 7 sites approved for Taiwan and we are working closely with Solar EPC companies like JV energy technology company on future solar sharing fish farms.

**Nocera’s Land Based RAS System**

This product offers superior performance with minimal environmental disturbance. Its efficacy and versatility result in a cleaner and safer aquatic ecosystem. An emphasis on environmental preservation is a priority with this design. RAS systems enable efficient and economical use of water resources, while also maintaining optimal conditions for aquatic life. High stocking densities of fish can be achieved in Recirculating Aquaculture Systems, leading to a decrease in demand for fresh water. This system is also applicable for fresh water or salt water species.

**A Look Into The Company’s Management Team:**

Jeff Cheng – CEO

Howard Ruan – COO

Jim Chuang – CFO

Kevin Chou – CSO

I wasn’t able to find too much on their management team. Has anyone heard of anyone of these guys before?

**Current Market Standing**

As of now, Nocera is trading at around $1.39 USD. They have an avg volume of around 20k a day. Pretty small company overall, but a couple of years ago they were trading at nearly $7. Markets are pretty bear and volatile right now with most stocks being in the red. I think in the next bull this could really go for a run. Even if share price recovers half of what it once was, this could be huge for shareholders. Pretty nice entry point to start a position in my opinion, but im just feeling a little green around the ears.

They've just finished an important early step in testing their new aircraft, called Midnight, and they did it super fast - in just three months! This company is working on electric planes that can take off and land straight up and down, which could totally change how we get around cities.

So, here's what's new: The Midnight plane got some advanced batteries installed, straight from Archer's own facilities in San Jose, California. This is a big deal because it means they're getting closer to making these planes a regular thing. They've moved past the first phase of their tests, doing all sorts of flying maneuvers to see how well the plane performs. Now, they're moving into the next phase, aiming to fly the plane in a way that mimics how it would in a normal trip, which is pretty exciting.

What's really interesting is that Archer is aiming to make trips across town way faster than driving, saying flights could be as quick as 10-20 minutes. The Midnight is designed to carry four people and be ready to fly again quickly after landing.

I'm curious to see how this goes and what it could mean for getting around in the future. Does anyone else have more info on Archer Aviation or thoughts on electric air taxis? Would love to hear what you think!"

Electric only cars I believe, have been overhyped and will fizzle with demands of battery element availability/ competition and mining ethicacy. Hydrogen / hybrid is probably more the way of the future. That said, a lot of cities have noise ordinances and are getting stricter in this area. Electric flying is somewhat minimal in that category when compared to combustion, and that's one area I think these have a future. Also air polution/ green initiatives are also part of the plan ( albeit charging comes from coal consumption  typically). As long as there's no issues with testing protocols, it could pay big returns. I like the cost to use model as the time saved seems reasonable compared to typical Lyft/Uber cost and time to destination can vary and time could be lost due to unseen additional traffic delays. Not so much in the sky. Really, the main exposure is loss to investment if something along the path to certification goes wrong and investment tanks...... worth the upside with minimal exposure, I think.Also think there's space fore more than one company ans compition is best for the consumer. Joby is anoth in this space fighting for recognition and territory. Don't put all your eggs in this basket, but the overall outlook is promising. My 2 cents"

Downside to this, which leads the thought the FAA could have them by the balls, is now that they have the certification, they MUST comply with consistent spending (monthly flights, training, employment).

They're starting to make a name for themselves in the green energy world by focusing on batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage, and helping with solutions to reduce carbon emissions. It's interesting to see a new player in the field that's focusing on making transportation and energy use cleaner.

Noco-Noco is doing a few different things. They're providing electric vehicles and energy storage systems to businesses, and they're also getting involved in projects that help reduce carbon emissions, including selling carbon credits. This involves analyzing land to find out how it can store more carbon, which is a step towards fighting climate change.

I'm curious about what this means for Noco-Noco's future and how they stack up in the green energy scene. Does anyone have more info on them or thoughts on how they might do? Their approach seems like a smart way to tackle several problems at once, but I'm interested in any challenges they might face or how effective their solutions are."

But here's the twist - this isn't the end of the road for e.GO. Instead, they've got until June 10, 2024, to bump up their share price back to $1.00 for at least 10 consecutive days. Think of it like a video game challenge where the company has to level up its stock price within a set time. This situation is a snapshot of the broader EV sector, which is all about innovation, overcoming hurdles, and driving towards a sustainable future. For those new to the scene, the EV market is where traditional automotives meet cutting-edge technology, aiming to revolutionize how we travel.

**Highlighted Main Points**

1. **Nasdaq Notice**: Next.e.GO received a notice from Nasdaq for not meeting the $1.00 per share bid price requirement.
2. **Grace Period**: The company has 180 days, until June 10, 2024, to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price requirement.
3. **Potential for a Turnaround**: Despite this challenge, Next.e.GO is actively considering options to meet Nasdaq’s requirements, indicating a proactive approach to this hurdle.

**TL;DR**

Next.e.GO’s recent Nasdaq notice is a bump in the road, but with a clear path and timeframe to regain compliance, it's an opportunity for a strong comeback in the EV sector."

About half of projected 2023 production volume is already covered by non-binding reservations. Going forward, we believe that the key to scaling and growing e.GO is the introduction of additional MicroFactories across continents, each with an estimated 18-24 month roll-out time.

At the close of the business combination, the combined company is expected to receive up to $235 million from Athena Consumer’s trust account, before taking into account potential impacts of redemptions. All of e.GO’s current shareholders are rolling 100% of their equity into the combined company, evidencing the clear alignment with all stakeholders.  We plan to use the transaction proceeds as follows: To support growth capital requirements, especially for ramping up the Aachen MicroFactory with increased material supply. Supporting increasing sales and implementing our go-to-market strategy, especially market entry outside of Germany in 2023.

Just checking if anyone has their eyes on any stocks at the moment. The markets are taking quite a hit this week, and my portfolio is feeling the heat. Just looking to diversify a bit.

Someone in my cord group mentioned Abacus Life. Apparently, they released their second-quarter results a few days back, and the numbers are looking pretty impressive. Their revenue saw a solid 30% year-over-year growth, reaching $18.3 million. What's even more impressive is that their underlying net income went up by 40% compared to the previous year, hitting $6.4 million. I must admit, their growth is catching my attention, but I'm not too familiar with the life insurance industry. Any insights?

I read somewhere that in the USA, life insurance policies can be treated as physical assets and sold to third parties. I find that concept pretty intriguing – it adds a unique twist to their business model.

They also launched Abacus Marketplace last week which is projected to make their whole business faster, easier and more reliable. They talk about incorporating smart contracts and blockchain tech too. Have a read here: [https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/abacus-life-announces-launch-abacus-120000011.html](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/abacus-life-announces-launch-abacus-120000011.html) 

Interestingly, the stock itself has gained about 20% in the past month and is steadily climbing towards its six-month high.

What sets Filament apart is their approach to using natural sources for their psychedelic drug candidates, which they believe could offer a more accessible and potentially safer alternative compared to synthetic options.

* **Clean Energy Buzz:** They're in the renewable energy sector, which is pretty hot right now. With the world going green, it seems like a good industry to be in. 
* **Expansion Moves:** Heard they've been expanding their operations across Europe. More reach, more potential?
* **Financials:** I skimmed through their financial statements (not my strong suit, but hey, trying to learn). They seem to be growing, but I'm no expert in reading these numbers.

**What I'm Curious About:**

* **Sustainability:** Is their growth sustainable? Or is it just good PR?
* **Competition:** How do they stack up against other players in the clean energy space?
* **Long-Term Play:** Is ALCE a solid pick for the long haul, or is it more of a short-term gain kind of deal?

Spread over the 5 years that’s 40m/year. Promising a 70% profit margin. Sol m completed training with their sales agents in January. Uk, Spain, France, governments have approved insujet for coverage under health care. Only thing left to do is go up to the doctors(which is SOLM’s job) and say “bro, your country will pay for it, just show it to your patients. No more needle wastes, no more needles hitting the streets. Kids gonna prefer this. Needle phobics will love this.” Boom sales. 

Also major side point NO ONE knows about! Insujet is also approved to administer Ozempic. And if you don’t know what that is, you’ve been under a rock. 

Now look at the Mexico sales that came in. They have been shipping units down there like crazy. Every 500 units is $220,000($400 a unit roughly). That’s in accordance with their deal with ScienceLink in Mexico. And they have a contract for 5000 this year!!! That doesn’t even include the fact that Mexico already increased the order by 1500 units!. 

So let’s do some math. 
Company shows -$2m in loss every year right? 
500units = $220k, with me? 
6500 units = $2.82m correct me if I’m wrong

2.82m income - 2m operating costs(+.5m for expansion, promotions, production costs, etc) 

= $600K in profit(yeah yeah take off taxes, hiring on extra staff, probably left with nothing.) 

But that’s just the Mexico stuff bringing thing up to a nice even net balance. 

Now go to the math on what a 5 year $203M contract adds to that?

By my viewing! Company should be at $27.00 a share within two years. 

However $25million for the whole company? Who’s to say someone doesn’t wanna just buy this up, and trash it, or part it out. Who knows. 

What are your thoughts?"

The company regained compliance for a short period, with its share price reaching $1.00 for ten consecutive days. However, it faced another dip, prompting Nasdaq to consider delisting. PBTS has requested a hearing with the Nasdaq Hearings Panel, scheduled for March 14, 2024, to appeal the delisting decision.

What this means is that O3 is expanding its exploration territory in an area known for significant gold deposits. For those who might not be deep into mining lingo, think of it like a video game where O3 Mining is grabbing more valuable land, potentially loaded with gold, to boost its resources and influence in the game. This move fits neatly into the bigger picture of the mining industry, which is all about finding and controlling areas rich in minerals, especially gold.

**Highlighted Main Points**

* O3 Mining acquired Kinebik Properties from NewOrigin and Cameron Properties from Globex, expanding its control over 40 km of strike in the Casa Berardi break.
* The company is betting big, paying cash and shares for these properties, signaling strong confidence in their value.
* This expansion aligns with the global narrative of mining companies striving to secure more resources, especially in gold-rich areas.

**TL;DR** O3 Mining Inc. is beefing up its portfolio by acquiring key mining properties in a gold-rich area, which is great news for the company's growth and presence in the sector.

Check the daily  chart. Wish I could add a picture of it! 😭 

\---

MIAMI--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--ShiftPixy, Inc. (Nasdaq: PIXY) (“ShiftPixy” or “the Company”), a Florida-based national staffing enterprise which designs, manages, and sells access to a disruptive, revolutionary platform that facilitates employment in the rapidly growing Gig Economy, today released a video further detailing its new “Fast Fill” recruiting technology first announced December 13, 2022. As reported at the time, many of the multi-unit fast food operators that endured the pandemic are now seeing activity pick up, but finding themselves unable to fill open positions, often due to weaker than ever “bench strength”. Fast Fill, which ShiftPixy is launching with a “Need Workers?” marketing campaign aimed at restaurant operators, is designed to directly reach available workers through mobile technology, encouraging immediate sign up for available QSR (quick service restaurant) shifts.

Smartphones have become a necessity of daily life, and have dramatically altered how people access information. Studies show that 94% of consumers look for local information on their smartphones, and 90% of those audiences take action as a result. The widespread use of smartphones to search the internet, shop, be entertained, and find local information provides marketers with the ability to target an audience that is constantly connected.

ShiftPixy’s extensive analytics enable its fast fill algorithm to precisely identify and target potential shift workers for population. Once a potential shift worker is identified, the fast fill algorithm connects with them to present shift work opportunities and immediately move them through a high touch digital process to put them to work on the opportunities they select.

“Keeping the bench full with qualified workers remains a challenge for today’s QSR operators, and our Fast Fill mobile technology allows them to reach the workers of today quickly and efficiently where they live and socialize,” said ShiftPixy Co-Founder and CEO, Scott Absher. “As discussed in the accompanying video, our most recent tests with our fast food clients needing to fill as many as 100 openings has exceeded expectations, turning what once was a six-month endeavor into perhaps a two-week success story. We’re capturing the attention of interested shift workers, motivating them to work and by so doing, accelerating the growth of our QSR clients.”

**About ShiftPixy**   
ShiftPixy is a disruptive human capital services enterprise, revolutionizing employment in the Gig Economy by delivering a next-gen platform for workforce management that helps businesses with shift-based employees navigate regulatory mandates, minimize administrative burdens and better connect with a ready-for-hire workforce. With expertise rooted in management’s more than 25 years of workers’ compensation and compliance programs experience, ShiftPixy adds a needed layer for addressing compliance and continued demands for equitable employment practices in the growing Gig Economy.

On the day competitor ALGN announced 26% sales growth and rose 15% on the news, SDC announced issuance of a 0% Notes to retire existing interest bearing loans and advance its growth plans in view of the booming demand for clear aligners. Short seller Hindenburg along with other HF took advantage of this news to shorting an additional 20MM shares in a matter of 3 days. The stock price, however, has held its support level at \~12.50 and shares available to short are extremely scarce. With a recent high of 16.08, this one is sure to fly higher on any squeeze. I've added to my LT position in recent days to cash in some gains, ahead of the company's earnings release at the end of the month.

Saw this recent noco-noco news that looked interesting but wanted to get your take on it.

&#x200B;

Article mentions they’re developing some new battery tech, X-SEPA separators. Apparently they have improved capacity retention rates and charging performance in various temperature conditions. I'm not exactly a tech savant here but overall seems like the batteries have better performance and a wide range of applications, from EVs to smartphones.

&#x200B;

Also on the manufacturer's end it costs them nothing to use. There’s no need for extra investments on their end to implement, seems like a plug and chug.  

&#x200B;

Haven't heard about them before but all the recent progress seems promising.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** New battery tech from noco-noco, better performance without added costs to implement for manufacturers. "

Def need a little chill weekend but before the day ends just thought I’d fire out a little post as I’m curious to hear some takes on small cap mining, specifically Uranium. 

I’ve always been a mining guy myself, and one of the biggest challenges when talking to companies and investors is that everyone claims they have big shiny rocks in the ground. Or that their deposit is beside some mine that pumped out 2+ million ounces last year or whatever. It's really hard to narrow it down to who is actually profitable. 

One sector I’ve been checking out recently is the uranium sector. I’ve overheard a couple of brokers I work with that they are interested in looking into some uranium deals due to the big global demand for it recently. It got me curious to do some research and digging on it myself which resulted in me coming across Myriad Uranium (M.CN). 

What caught my attention is that they actually operate out of Niger Africa, which isn’t really a massive country for uranium exploration currently but that is going to change soon. The proof behind that is that a lot of new players want to enter the scene there based on recent news of high grade uranium samples being discovered by Orano. However, Myriad has that first movers advantage everyone wants to know about. Myriad has licenses running through the Tim Mersoï Basin which is Africa’s largest uranium deposit according to various sources. On top of that Myriads Geophysics program will be beginning later this summer and into the fall which has their community pretty amped up. 

I know I mentioned early that so many mining companies say stuff like this but Myriad operates in a very unique area. There are not a ton of players in their area yet which is why they stand out to me a little more than others. Would love for any of you to take a look into them with me, and happy to get some discussion going here! Let me know what you guys think! "

They're part of a pioneering effort to extract vital metals from the ocean floor, which could play a big role in supporting the shift towards clean energy. This effort puts them at the heart of discussions on sustainable resource extraction.

Recently, a peaceful protest by Greenpeace brought attention to the environmental discussions surrounding deep-sea mining. It highlights the ongoing dialogue between industry players and environmental groups about the best ways to balance technological advancement with ecological care. The Metals Company is actively involved in research aimed at understanding the environmental impacts of their work, contributing to a broader conversation about responsible resource use.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on how technology and environmental stewardship can go hand in hand in this new frontier. The Metals Company's role in this space seems to be a noteworthy example of striving for innovation while engaging with important ecological questions. Anyone else following this or have insights into the sustainable practices being considered in deep-sea mining?"

Fortunately, I had a chance to try the **Streetbeat** app personally, and I can make a few comments. First, using data-based machine learning algorithms really works well with ready-to-trade investment solutions from professional financiers. It saves a lot of time and diversifies investment decisions. Secondly, when investing with this app in stocks, DeFi in cryptocurrency, you have an opportunity to trust the data of reputable hedge funds, not guesses. Anyway, I like the policy of democratizing data for everyday investors."

This company's spread across a surprising range of sectors. They're into crypto mining, AI, the metaverse, even renewable energy.  Now, I'm usually into more focused plays, but this has me intrigued.

They just launched this AI/metaverse air cargo platform, which sounds pretty wild.  And they seem committed to renewable energy for their crypto mining operations. Plus, they recently announced a stock dividend.  It's a total mixed bag, but I can't deny the ambition.

Full disclosure, this isn't financial advice. You've got to do your own research. But if you're looking for a wildcard stock with a lot of potential upside (and downside), this one's worth checking out."

Baird, which is primarily a microwave ablation device provider in China, has recently expanded into the U.S. market after receiving FDA clearance. They reported some impressive financial numbers, so I thought it was worth a deeper look.

In terms of numbers, Baird Medical’s revenue reached $13.1 million, marking a 13.8% year-over-year increase. Even more notable, their net income jumped by 85.8% to $4.4 million. They’re also gaining traction in the U.S. after FDA clearances, targeting the large thyroidectomy market, which reportedly sees around 150,000 procedures annually. The company completed a business combination with ExcelFin Acquisition Corp. earlier this month, and Baird Medical’s shares now trade on Nasdaq under the ticker ""BDMD.""

Anyone else following this stock? It’s interesting to see their strategy as they enter the U.S. market. Let me know if you’ve got more insights into the company or how this tech might shake up the thyroid treatment space"

Seems like EveryLife, a subsidiary of PublicSqaure, is giving back in a massive way.

&#x200B;

I keep hearing about PublicSquare and all the values they represent, so news like this is pretty exciting to see that they’re putting their money where their mouth is so to speak. If anyones followed them for a while, I'd love to hear more insights about when they’ve done similar things. 

&#x200B;

Here’s the main points summarized:

* EveryLife donated over 523,000 diapers and nearly 123,000 wipes in the first quarter of 2024
* Their ""Buy For A Cause"" program partners with pro-life organizations and allows consumers to purchase and donate diaper and wipe bundles directly to pregnancy resource centers
* They're also running diaper drives and partnering with various organizations to assist families in need

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** EveryLife, subsidiary of PublicSquare, donated over half a million diapers and thousands of wipes to families in need in the first quarter of 2024."

The main bit is that they’re gearing up for a big exploration push in Ontario, but here’s more details on the whole thing:

They’re launching a modern VTEM Plus geophysical survey to refine drill targets at their Chrome Puddy property in Ontario

The survey and additional groundwork like rock sampling and mapping aim to prepare for drilling in Q4 2024

The project targets nickel, copper, cobalt, and platinum group metals, which are essential for electric vehicle batteries and green tech

This is essentially my first news piece or ig general look at them. So beyond surface level I dont really have a take, just trying to learn. If anyone here has more experience with them, I’d love to hear what you think about this."

They're opening up a second office in Guadalajara, Mexico, in the La Colonia Americana area. Sounds like they’re really focusing on growing their nearshoring capabilities, which makes sense with how popular it’s becoming for U.S. companies trying to keep operations close by without the heavy costs.

This new office will handle a bunch of different roles like customer service, tech support, and training. It seems like a good move to improve efficiency for their clients. Plus, they already have operations in Mexico, so this just adds to their presence there. The COO, Ajay Khare, mentioned that the new location has a solid talent pool, which is an advantage for the company.

Nearshoring is clearly on the rise, and with 80% of companies in North America thinking about it, this move seems pretty timely for Aeries. Anyone else been following their recent moves or have more insights into how this could impact them long-term?"

This patent covers a two-step vaccination process involving a DNA vector encoding multiple HIV antigens in virus-like particles (VLPs) for the initial boost, followed by a second round using GeoVax's vector platform. This innovative approach is a significant leap forward in HIV prevention.

**Highlighted Main Points:**

* **Innovative Vaccination Approach:** GeoVax's method involves a dual-step process that starts with a DNA vector encoding various HIV antigens in virus-like particles. This primes the immune system. The second step employs GeoVax's vector platform using an MVA viral vector to amplify the response.
* **CEO David Dodd's Insights:** Dodd emphasizes their current focus on a next-gen COVID-19 vaccine in Phase 2 trials and a cancer immunotherapy program, with Gedeptin® leading the charge in Phase 1/2 clinical trials. While HIV research isn't the primary focus at the moment, it remains a crucial part of their broader development strategy.
* **Promising HIV Study Results:** GeoVax's MVA-vectored HIV vaccine played a key role in an experimental combinational HIV therapy study. The trial's goal was a functional cure for HIV-positive individuals. The treatment demonstrated exceptional immunogenicity, especially in T cell immunity, even in compromised immune systems due to HIV infection.

**TLDR:**

GeoVax Labs, Inc. scores a big win with a patent for their cutting-edge HIV vaccine approach. The method involves a two-step vaccination process, setting a new standard in HIV prevention. CEO David Dodd highlights their ongoing focus on COVID-19 and cancer immunotherapy, while acknowledging the pivotal role of the HIV program in their overall development strategy.

Would love to hear what you guys think. 

&#x200B;

So basically, they’ve successfully integrated their latest battery systems with wireless chargers. What's super cool is that these wireless charging capabilities are on par with traditional wired chargers, which is a big win for convenience and efficiency. 

Instead of dealing with tangled wires and manual monitoring while charging EV cars, you can just let them juice up wirelessly. Plus, with Electrovaya's monitoring platform, EVISION, you can keep tabs on everything remotely, making operations smoother and more efficient. 

&#x200B;

In simpler terms, their latest tech not only makes our gadgets easier to charge but also opens up possibilities for more seamless integration of renewable energy solutions into our everyday lives.

Just saw some big news about Canoo Inc. ($GOEV) that I wanted to share. They just got approval for their Oklahoma City place to be a Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ). This seems like a pretty big deal for how they make and sell their electric vehicles.

So, what's the big deal with this approval? It means Canoo can save some money on parts they bring in from other countries and on the electric vehicles they sell outside the U.S. They say over 90% of their parts are from the U.S. and friends, and this approval lets them cut costs. For cars they sell abroad, it could make things up to 5% cheaper on some parts. And for cars sold here, they can wait longer to pay some taxes and fees, which helps them use their money better.

This seems like a win for Canoo because it could help them make and sell their electric vehicles more efficiently. They're also planning to grow their site in Oklahoma City, which could mean more jobs and more cars made in the U.S. What do you all think about this? Does anyone know more about Canoo or how this might help them out?"

They IPO'd around 6 months ago and no insiders have sold shares which is a great sign. This one is bottomed out sitting near the all time low with very active PRs.

SHORTS ARE COMPLETELY TRAPPED AND HAVENT COVERED. Micro floats are the penny stock theme right now with $DWTX running from $1 to $30 and this one has the same 1m float.

**This $15M MC Company effectively managed the supply chain requirements of major online retailers such as Amazon ($2.5T), Walmart ($750B), and Wayfair ($6B)**

**This is a Logistics company with around 50 employees that operates over 85,000 square feet of warehousing with 35+ loading docks.**

Back in November, **they acquired a company that will give them $7M in yearly revenue**. This will start to show on their next financials, and they did $4.1M in revenue the last Quarter that came out.

**They secured a $1.5M sales agreement just recently, and 2 days ago secured distribution agreements with Kelun Pharmaceutical which is around a $50B Company**

$LSH operates three major regional warehousing and distribution centers in the United States, located in Illinois, Texas, and California. **These centers collectively cover approximately 85,000 square feet with 35 docks and can handle up to 3,000 cubic meters of freight daily**.

There isn’t any DD out I can refer too but I already started looking in the company. The financials and the stock performance is what made me like the company. I All this info is from otcmarkets and they are not audited so keep that in mind. They did 10.4M in revenue compared to 1.8M the previous year, also they were net profitable for the past 3 consecutive quarters. They also have a healthy balance sheet 24M in assets and only 6M in liabilities. Hard to find OTC with financials like this one and I think the next thing the company needs to do is audit their financials.

The stock doesn't have any selling pressure and no one really knows the stock yet so it doesn’t really get much volume. The chart pretty much makes it clear, one thing to note is that the longterm performance is actually better than any otc because it’s literally like the only pinksheet without sellers.

The revenue growth rate is the main that stood out to me so I think that might be the real kicker

Thank you for reading

1. I  am an MD and a Professor. To spell out the obvious, I have insight into  what matters in the medical world. Many pure researchers lack this  (cough cough Elisabeth Bik). In addition, As medical school faculty, If I  can't figure it out, I know who to ask.
2. I started investing (profitably) before most of you were born.

Why  flex? To make it abundantly clear, my opinion on biotech investing  matters just a little. With that said, once more, listen up!

**The Pickle:**

You  youngins haven't noticed, but Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of  death in the US. Currently, Alzheimer's is an epidemic. The kicker is,  there is NO effective treatment.

The  FDA needed a drug so desperately they approved Aduhelm. This drug has  significant adverse events. The risk of brain swelling requires serial  Brain MRIs. It also requires a demented patient to sit through an IV  infusion (every six weeks) and costs more than $50k. Most incredible is  that Biogen's medication is NO BETTER THAN A SUGAR PILL in two separate  trials (so remember Biogen's drug sucks for a different point I'll make  later).

Again, for emphasis, the  FDA still approved it because the need is that severe. President Biden  recently pointed out that Alzheimer's disease could soon cost the nation  over a trillion dollars.

**The Fix: $SAVA**

Cassava  Science's revolutionary Alzheimer's drug, Simufilam, improved cognitive  function in its CMS trial. The degree and duration of improvement have  NEVER been achieved, EVER for AD (Alzheimer's dementia)! It's historic.  It also enhanced behavior. Family members with AD patients know that  behavior is the overwhelming factor for family, but unfortunately, it  doesnt get enough attention. Lastly, and critically to patients (and the  discussion ahead), there were NO significant adverse events.

Yes,  we can argue about nuances like study design, the N, etc. A genuine  criticism of the study is its initially open-label. However, biased  critics will ignore Simufilams effect has been far more robust than the  usual placebo effect (88% vs. 30%). Those with ulterior motives  conveniently forget that a placebo arm is being introduced to the  ongoing phase 2 CMS study as we speak.

Without  getting too technical, the best way to settle the few sincere  criticisms is Phase 3 trials. There is no valid argument against this  statement. This is one of those few moments where it's safe to use  absolute phrases. If you take away only one point from this article,  then remember, Phase 3 trials should move forward. The study will start  early to mid-October at the dismay of Jordan Thomas (the villain, more  about him later). Anyone who disagrees with further testing is not after  the truth or and they are certainly not being objective. They are also  threatening a much-needed potential breakthrough therapy. Be angry,  fellow apes, be angry. Im just getting started, BTW.

Do  market gurus like Blackrock and Vanguard believe this is a big deal?  They do. That is why the stock price went from < $1 to an ATH of  $147. So is it a buy at $50 (market cap of 2 billion)? My advice to my  family is to load up! Now let's address why the stock crashed in the  first place.

**The Villan and His Massacre:**

Jordan  Thomas, a scumbag lawyer, presented the FDA with a ""Citizens Petition.""  A team shorting SAVA drafted this said Citizens Petition (not lawsuit)  out of concern for patient SAFETY (remember this point, it is critical  to understanding motives). If that wasn't enough, Jordan Thomas filed  another two addendums following the petitions over the last two weeks.

Essentially, it was around 70 pages full of technical jargon and a myriad of inconsequential details. **The document was scary to read as an MD**.  Im sure the average person, first, shit in their pants, and, second,  sold their shares. SAVA fell 55% in 3 days (overreaction play in the  making? most definitely). As emotions have settled, this blog ([https://ad-science.org/](https://ad-science.org/)),  Cassava itself, and many experts, including myself, rightly called it  biased and fiction. The essentials from the petition and rebuttals.

1. Jordan  Thomas has tried three times to halt clinical research on a drug that  patients are literally dying as they wait. WTF!? Why, why why?? If you  aren't angry, somethings wrong with you. JT states he is concerned for  patient safety. However, as also mentioned above (multiple times), there  is no evidence that Simufilam harmed a patient, period. So as expected,  JT is unable to offer proof of patient harm. You read that correctly.  In over seventy pages, there is no mention of patient harm. Then why did  JT cite safety as his concern, despite having NO evidence? Because that  is the \*only\* reason, the FDA will halt trials. Again, if Simufilam is  safe and has shown to be a potential treatment, then the study shall  continue. Oh, did I mention that the vast majority (>90%) of these  petitions fail? Did I also note that Jordan Thomas' track record is  horrendous (3% success rate)? Synopsis: JT is an incompetent lawyer who  uses a failed method to frighten investors from their position using FUD  in its purest form.
2. Then  why the massive selloff? As I mentioned earlier, reading an enormous  document full of details, even I, a literal verifiable SAVAge (maybe  even a SAVAnt?) and professor/physician, was overwhelmed and anxious.  Ultimately, I did not sell a single share. I did, however, increase my  position by 30%. With that said, Im not surprised the masses started  selling. Clearly, though, it was an overreaction. Even more apparent,  it's an \*opportunity\*—a second chance to buy the stock on clearance.

**The Financials:**

$SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. Funding isn't a near-term issue.

Fifty  million patients are suffering from AD globally. 6 million of those  patients reside in the US. Let's say SAVA captures 1/4 of the American  market and nothing internationally. Further, let's say the therapy costs  $20k annually, just a bit over a third the cost of aducanumab (Biogen's  soon to fail drug):

1,500,000 patients X $20,000 X 5 multiple = $150,000,000,000

That  calculation is ridiculously conservative for a Simufilam if it ends up  as good as it looks (in a market with no other effective treatment  options). The current stock price is $50. The overly conservative  valuation would put SAVA's SP at $3750

The above does not factor in SavaDx or expanded label use for seizures and other types of dementia.

**Once Again Elaborating On The Need:**

If  you have a heart attack, Stroke, Pneumonia, or any of the leading  causes of death, there are treatments- actually, many treatments. I'm a  hospital-based physician and regularly see all the common causes of  death, so why does AD stand out? Again, there is no effective treatment.  Thats devastating for patients, but families? It's not uncommon for  families to drop their loved ones off in the ER because they ""can't  handle it anymore."" This market is massive and unaddressed! Severely,  painfully, and gravely unaddressed.

I  have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires  (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process. JT is only the  face of this farce. Behind him are many short positions making a 100  million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their  short-term gain. There is something far more concerning.

**The Plot Thickens:**

What  I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or  short-term price action. There is something much more sinister. Biogen  has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved. Now it  is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a  problem:

FDA advisory committee  voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then  saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently,  a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and  Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to  support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and  Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the  country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's  AD drug. This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you  to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no  other therapy on the market. Well, what happens if a new, more effective  medication shows up?

**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**

Back  to our Villian JT. JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the  initial ""Citizens Patetion"") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works. Why? I  speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous  whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried  about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in  profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is  more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer. There is  little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less. When that  happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug. Biogen already  has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to  rejuvenate the companies earnings. Then expediently and as expected,  Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.

I  believe that is the root issue. Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become  furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam! A group of us have  gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to  investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).

**Short term price action:**

1. Im  expecting the SP to bounce. After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a  perfect overreaction play. If you dont know what Im talking about, you  can look up ""overreaction with reversion to the mean.""
2. Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within ""weeks to months.""
3. Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks. (""Soon"" per Remi)
4. Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.

\#SAVA's  float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted  with utilization of >90%. It'll take very little to make SAVA move,  big. Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.

I  have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on  SAVA. My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!). I'll  finish with one last piece of advice. Over 19 years of investing, my  most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading  and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment  by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further  propagated by ""experts"" tweeting and commenting with their hidden  agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual  published results, but apparently, her opinion counts? Comments of her  blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical  vernacular to cause panic. Something along the lines of, ""oh, he sounds  smart, so he must be right."" or ""That sounds complicated, he must be on  to something."" In reality, Jordan Thomas screamed fire in a theater.  Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical  details are fooling many. DFV saw something well before masses, and he  was paid handsomely for it.

If my  opinion piece has motivated you to join SAVA's fight against Biogen,  then buy shares, spread the knowledge. Sleep well if you decide to go in  with me, knowing this is a righteous fight: six million AD patients vs.  a slimy lawyer, his short crew, and big Pharma.

I am long. I have been wrong many times, and I am not a financial advisor. Do your own DD before making any decisions."

Join us as we delve into their latest triumph – the initiation of treatment for the third patient in a groundbreaking clinical trial in collaboration with Moffitt Cancer Center. Our focus? A novel chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy designed to take on the challenges posed by ovarian cancer.

**Highlighted Main Points:**

* Anixa Biosciences, Inc.  partners with Moffitt Cancer Center to launch treatment for the third patient in a pioneering clinical trial.
* The clinical trial (NCT05316129) takes place at Moffitt Cancer Center and is a Phase 1 dose-escalation study.
* The primary objectives include evaluating therapy safety, determining the maximum tolerated dose of T-cells targeting follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), and preliminarily assessing clinical activity.
* Patients in the trial have progressive disease and have undergone at least two therapeutic interventions.
* The third patient receives the same dose of engineered T-cells as the first and second patients.
* Assuming safety is confirmed in the third patient, Anixa plans to initiate treatment for the second cohort in Q4 2023, with three times the cell dose compared to the first cohort.
* Anixa's approach is called chimeric endocrine receptor T-cell (CER-T) therapy, targeting FSHR, which is exclusively expressed on ovarian cells in healthy adult females.
* While CAR-T therapy has shown promise for hematological tumors, Anixa's approach targets solid tumors, like ovarian cancer, where effective targeting is more complex.
* Dr. Robert Wenham, Principal Investigator of the trial and Chair of Gynecologic Oncology Program at Moffitt Cancer Center, expresses optimism about the trial's progress.
* Dr. Amit Kumar, Chairman and CEO of Anixa Biosciences, highlights the completion of the first cohort despite slow patient enrollment and anticipates moving forward to the next higher dose cohort.

**TLDR:** 

Attention, biotech enthusiasts! Anixa Biosciences, Inc.  is making waves with its partnership with Moffitt Cancer Center. Together, they've launched treatment for the third patient in a groundbreaking clinical trial targeting ovarian cancer. This Phase 1 trial aims to assess therapy safety, determine optimal T-cell doses, and evaluate clinical activity. Patients with progressive disease and multiple prior interventions are enrolled. Anixa's innovative approach, called chimeric endocrine receptor T-cell (CER-T) therapy, uniquely targets ovarian cells through the FSHR receptor. If safety is confirmed, the next cohort will receive a higher cell dose. Though slow patient enrollment is common, the completion of the first cohort is a significant milestone.

They’re basically a VC firm with over 70 investments in the hottest sectors including AI, block chain, biotech, mining, cannabis

The CEO, Sheldon actually has a insane track record and had multiple unicorn exits in the past. Going to post a lot of DD on this company and their holdings

Being a VC firm, $IDKFF has exposure into equity in early seed financing rounds with companies that ordinary investors can’t even touch, especially with the accredited investor rule for private companies. This gives IDKFF shareholders a low entry points and a highly favourable risk/reward on their investments. Basically being able to invest in potential unicorns prior to going public or being bought out. With active investments in currently over 70 companies this is one to watch out for.

$IDKFF CEO Sheldon Inwentash had success in the past with leading a holdings company, Pinetree Capital with some unicorn investments including Queenston Mining (acquired by Osisko Mining Corp. for $550-million), Aurelian Resources (acquired by Kinross for $1.2-billion) and Gold Eagle Mines (acquired by Goldcorp for $1.5-billion) just to name some.

I looked through some of IDKFF investments and already seen a few potential unicorns. G
oing to post about them next. They have a YouTube channel where they sit down and talk with the management of the companies that they’re invested in.

Here’s a little more info on just 3 out of the 70 companies in IDKFF holdings

Micropayments - TODAQ (ledger-less ""blockchain"" working with banks) enables, for the first time ever, cost effective (fraction of a penny), controlled and convenient Micropayments. TODAQ is working with the likes of Google, Banks such as CIBC and RBC. As well as institutions like Cambridge Univeristy and many more. A 30 year dream the founders of the internet weren't able to achieve is complete.
 
AI to AI - HyperCycle is being described as the ""Internet of AI"". An AI that talks to other AI to complete tasks for a user; fixed fee and only paid when product is delivered to stop costs of recruitment for the first time ever. Allowing you to comfortably go outside of your ""friend network"". Ben Goertzel the founder of SingularityNet is behind this project with Toufi Saliba. They have had talks with Nvidia. Sheldon was then later at the recent Nvidia conference.
 
Neuroscience  - Neurable enables, for the first time ever, brainwaves/signals to be measured effectively, without the need for an invasive chip like seen with Elon Musk's company NeuraLink. Neurable is doing this through headphones in partnership with headphone company Master & Dynamic.

However, even seasoned investors can find some use out of this by getting back to the basics. This quick guide isn't meant to focus on financial metrics, but in an effort to explore companies based on the world around us.

Preface: This is directed for individuals that are just starting to invest, in hopes of empowering them to continue to grow upon the knowledge they learn on in this post! This is also a post to help highlight a new social investing platform I've been building called [Mainstreet](https://mainstreetportfolio.com/) (currently in beta) that helps you invest with your friends, track your portfolios, and build communities with one another. Happy investing!

**How To Find Stocks (for the Normal Investor)**

One of the most common questions I get when talking to someone just getting into investing, is something along the lines of “Which stocks are good?” or “How do I find stocks to invest in?”. Some of the reasons individuals choose not to invest is due to the “lack of knowledge” or perhaps they are “intimidated by the market”. These are all valid reasons to not invest, but I feel like by providing the education and resources to learn about these topics in an easy and digestible manner will help people overcome these barriers and feel empowered to take control of their wealth, whether it’s through real estate, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.

In this article, I’ll dive into some of the strategies and methods I used to help gain knowledge and insight when investing in the stock market. Keep in mind this is not the definitive guide, but it’s steps that I took to help me become more financially literate about the stock market. Everyone’s path to financial education is different and unique and this is only meant to provide a different perspective for someone just starting out.

**Pay Attention to the World Around You**

The first thing I usually tell people is, start to observe the world around you and the businesses that are close to your network. You’ll easily be able to find many companies if you start to shift your mindset and look at how the world functions.

First, look at what kind of products or services you consume. Do you need to get your fix of vanilla latte at Starbucks ($SBUX) in the morning? More of a fast food person? Let’s look at McDonalds ($MCD), Chipotle ($CMG), Shake Shack ($SHAK), or Restaurant Brands International ($QSR). Are you a hardcore gamer? Well, I’m sure one of your games or consoles comes from Sony ($SNE), Nintendo ($NTDOY), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO), or Microsoft ($MSFT). Or maybe you’ve been working from home? I’m sure you’ve had to buy some products from Amazon ($AMZN) or Wayfair ($W) to spruce up your office space. You’re probably also using things like Zoom ($ZM), Google Drive ($GOOG or $GOOGL), or Slack to keep yourself productive during the day.

**Build a Watchlist**

Now that we’ve got the brain working a little, it’s important to start building a watchlist of all the stocks you’ve thought of. You can use your broker watchlist tool, or even an app like Yahoo Finance, WeBull, etc. Sort them in a way that works for you, whether it’s by sector (financial, tech, industrials), subsector (gaming, oil, e-commerce), or even by priority (Watchlist Tier 1, Watchlist Tier 2, etc.)

Organization is key when building your watchlist. You’ll want to have them organized because it’ll help you get a quick glance of what’s happening in the market at any given time. By checking on the stocks you’ve added to your watchlist periodically, you’ll learn how they move according to catalysts (market news, earnings, etc) and be able to plan how and when you’d like to invest in them.

**Search within an Index Fund or ETF**

A great way to search up companies is by looking at current index fund or ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) allocations. With index funds, you can look at the holdings of the S&P500 (Top 500 American companies) or the Nasdaq 100 (Most active, largest 100 Nasdaq companies). At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of the S&P500 are:

1. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)
2. Microsoft Corp ($MSFT)
3. Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN)
4. Facebook, Inc. ($FB)
5. Alphabet Inc. Class A ($GOOGL)
6. Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG)
7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc ($BRK.B)
8. JPMorgan Chase & Co. ($JPM)
9. Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA)
10. Johnson & Johnson ($JNJ)

Another way is to look into the holdings of an ETF. There are tons of ETFs out there that track indices like $SPY and $QQQ, which track the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, as well as more focused sector ETFs, like the ARK Innovation Fund ($ARKK) or the O’Shares Global Internet Giants Fund ($OGIG).

One of my favorites is ARKK, as they focus on disruptive innovation and change. So, for example, if something like this was to resonate with you, looking into their top holdings will give you some insight on what kinds of companies you’d need to do research on to gain exposure to this particular strategy. At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of ARKK are:

1. Tesla, Inc ($TSLA)
2. Teladoc Health, Inc. ($TDOC)
3. Roku, Inc. ($ROKU)
4. Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)
5. Square, Inc. ($SQ)
6. Shopify, Inc ($SHOP)
7. Spotify Technology SA ($SPOT)
8. Twilio, Inc (TWLO)
9. Coinbase Global, Inc ($COIN)
10. Unity Software, Inc ($U)

Hopefully looking into index funds or ETFs like the ones listed above help spark curiosity and the urge to build on your own knowledge!

**Invest in Things You Understand (Personal, Business)**

Another piece of advice I like to give people is to only invest in areas of the market you understand. For example, if I see a sector like biotech or cybersecurity shoot up 50% in the last three months, but I don’t really understand how this industry works, don’t put your money in it. Simple as that. If the whole stock market started to fall, these will be the easiest to target as a potential sell because you don’t understand the industry or the company at all. Your conviction on the stock is low so incentive to hold onto it for the long term is also low.

For me, I’m a big gamer and I understand the industry well. To compare it to the previous example above, I can take those companies and further extrapolate to build upon my research using my existing knowledge. As a result, I’m aware that gaming consoles use chips from Intel ($INTC), Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), as well as GPU processors from Nvidia ($NVDA). Many video games are developed on software applications like Unity ($U). I’m also aware that a large population of gamers and gaming companies come from Asia and Europe, therefore I can look into stocks like Ubisoft ($UBI), Capcom ($CCOEF), or even Tencent Holdings ($TCEHY). What about gaming accessories from Corsair ($CRSR) or Logitech ($LOGI)? And let’s not forget about Gamestop ($GME)!

Another great way to leverage your knowledge is to look at your workplace and how the business is structured from within. Does your company utilize products or services from other companies? If you work at a software company, perhaps you use Cisco ($CSCO) or Ciena ($CIEN) for your networking. If your company uses customer or sales support, you may be using something like Salesforce ($CRM), Twilio ($TWLO), or Zendesk ($ZEN). To optimize your business, your company may also be leveraging cybersecurity services like Palo Alto ($PALO), Okta ($OKTA), or Crowdstrike ($CRWD). By looking within your own workplace, you’ll be able to do a bit of deeper digging to find stocks that services businesses and aren’t as customer facing.

Understanding an industry well allows you to build your conviction in that industry. By fully grasping the ins and outs, you’ll know exactly what you’re invested in. This prevents panicking or selling if you suddenly see a red day, because you know what the company is fundamentally and potentially capable of. It also allows you to get invested in the companies you’re buying, ultimately feeling like a small owner of the company, which is exactly what the function of stocks are.

**Diversify your Portfolio**

So now, you’ve done a bit of research and found a ton of stocks you might potentially invest in. Now what? Well, now is where you want to think about risk management and portfolio diversity.

From Investopedia, diversification is a “risk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.”

How do I know what’s diversified enough? Great question, but that’s up to your personal risk tolerance. Try not to allocate all your stocks into one single sector or area of the market. By broadening out in sector (tech, industrial), subsector (5G, banks), geography (US, Asia, Europe), market cap (large, medium, small), and more, you can feel comfortable and confident with your investments. The last thing you want to be doing is checking your stocks every minute and wondering if you should buy more or sell it off. Also consider the timeline of your allocations. The majority of my portfolio is in long-term investments (3+ years), but I do have a small portion of my portfolio allocated to mid-term and momentum investments (less than two years), such as options and swing trading. It’s up to each individual investor to determine these allocations and stay committed to knowing when to change your allocation based on your time horizon.

Consider this portfolio of $10000 dollars: (Stock, dollar amount\[%\], sector/subsector/geography/market cap)

* Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA - $1000 (10%) - Tech / EV / USA / Large
* Alibaba Group ($BABA) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / E-Commerce / ASIA / Large
* Bank of America ($BAC) - $1000 (10%) - Financials / Banking / USA / Large
* GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Pharma / EU / Large
* Brookfield Renewable ($BEP)- $1000 (10%) - Energy / Renewable / CAN / Large
* Papa John’s Int. ($PZZA)- $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Consumer/ USA / Mid
* Ubisoft Entertainment ($UBI) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / Gaming / EU / Mid
* Barrick Gold ($GOLD) - $1000 (10%) - Industrials / Mining / CAN / Mid
* Aurora Cannabis ($ACB) - $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Cannabis / CAN / Small
* Nano-X Imaging ($NNOX) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Telehealth / Israel / Small

As you can see, we’ve been able to allocate into many different sectors, subsectors, geographies, and market caps. If one of these companies were to disappear tomorrow, we’d still have 90% of our portfolio remaining.

Of our mock portfolio, our sector allocation is the following: 30% Technology, 20% Consumer, 20% Health, and 10% each in Financials, Energy, and Industrials. Our subsector allocation is fully diversified in 10 subsectors of the market: Electric Vehicles, E-Commerce, Banking, Pharma, Renewable Energy, Consumer, Gaming, Mining, Cannabis, and Telehealth. In terms of geography, our allocation is the following: 30% USA, 30% Canada, 20% Europe, 10% Asia, and 10% Israel. With our market cap, our allocation is the following: 50% large, 30% mid, and 20% small. As you can see, this portfolio is well diversified in terms of sector, subsector, region, and market cap. These allocations will ultimately be up to you, as you will be in control of your portfolio.

**Now You’re Ready!**

And that’s it, we’ve learned how to find stocks by looking at your surroundings using your own knowledge from your personal and work life and now you understand how to properly diversify a portfolio based on your own risk tolerance and time horizon.

Despite the numerous upcoming earnings reports, Elon Musk's pursuit of Twitter (TWTR) could still be the top watch this week, with new twists anticipated after the company responded to his hostile takeover bid with a “poison pill” strategy. Some analysts believe that Twitter is unlikely to recapture its all-time-high of $80.75 per share from last year, and that a deal with Musk or another buyer may be the best strategy. 

As jam packed as this week may be, the biggest driver of the overall market will likely be the continued pessimism of interest rates, inflation and war in Europe. Analysts will be sifting through company commentaries to see how all of these things are impacting the bottom line. Forward guidance could continue to be poor. Companies are going to whine and complain about cost pressures, even when they’re going to report improved results. So that may cause price action to be a little sloppier.

Hopefully this graphic can help you navigate your investing and trading decisions. Save this post for reference and let me know what’s on your watchlist in the comments. Good luck with your trading!"

Look through the s&p 500 and pick the best companies. Go to stockanalyzer.com & search for that stock. Click “financials” and go to revenue. Look at see if their revenue is increasing every year. For example, look at Microsoft & amazons growth. That’s the type of growth you want. 

Look at the net profit also. Make sure it doesn’t have a negative sign, meaning that the company loses money aka they aren’t profitable. 

After you’ve found great companies, you want to look at the chart of that stock. Do not buy a stock at its all time high. Wait for a nice pullback and buy it. Do not be afraid of days where the market is red. That is a buying opportunity if you have great companies.

post,2023-01-14 21:56:00,10c1ane,stockstobuytoday,Universal cancer vaccine with very promising effect! (Multi-bagger potential),Ultimovacs4ever,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/10c1ane/universal_cancer_vaccine_with_very_promising/,16,1.0,0.91,"Imagine a world where cancer treatment is revolutionized by a single breakthrough discovery - a universal cancer vaccine with incredibly promising results. This revolutionary new vaccine has the potential to improve outcomes in all immunotherapies and offer long-lasting effects without the need for screening. Not only that, but it also boasts a good safety profile, is ready to use off the shelf, and easy to administer.

**Are you ready to dive into the details of this groundbreaking discovery? Keep reading to find out more.**

The potential for a new and innovative cancer treatment could be just around the corner, as Ultimovacs conducts a revolutionary clinical trial, INITIUM, across the United States and Europe. This Phase II randomized trial is evaluating the use of a cancer vaccine called UV1 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) ipilimumab and nivolumab for the treatment of first-line metastatic malignant melanoma. The trial design is event-driven, meaning that the primary endpoint will be reached when a certain number of events, such as disease progression or death, have occurred. Specifically, the trial will reach its endpoint when 70 progression-free survival (PFS) events have been recorded.

With 156 patients already enrolled in the INITIUM trial, who are randomly assigned to receive either the combination treatment or CPIs alone, Ultimovacs has been providing regular updates on the enrolment status to investors. Though the company has not explicitly stated the hypothesis being tested, it is believed to be a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.60, which would correspond to 41 events in the control arm and 29 in the experimental arm.

There are two large historical trials in malignant melanoma that can be used as controls for INITIUM: Checkmate-067 and Checkmate-511. Both of these trials had the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as INITIUM, so it is reasonable to expect similar PFS event rates in the control arm of INITIUM. Using the recruitment curve and the PFS curves from Checkmate-067 and Checkmate-511, it is possible to estimate the number of events that are likely to have occurred in the control arm of INITIUM. If the control arm in INITIUM progresses at the same rate as in Checkmate-067, the primary endpoint will be reached at the end of this month. If the INITIUM study can be more accurately compared to the Checkmate-511 study, the results may even meet the requirements for accelerated approval within a few weeks.

&#x200B;

Here is an overview that illustrates the progress compared to CM-067. The chart shows that assuming there are 70 events today, there is a higher likelihood of achieving a significant outcome (i.e. a minimum of 41 events).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4jr3pc7vx2ca1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c09457443a716e4461237dacba9e521091a8985

The next graph illustrates the development compared to CM-511 and CM-067. The chart shows that the estimated chances of achieving a significant outcome using CM-511 and CM-067 as a reference, assuming today's readings, range between 77% and 53%, and the probability that UV1 has no effect is between 2%-8%.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p3zd4kcxx2ca1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=de4d0ae77b6877403ed6b3fbd7515fc1dcaf37af

Overall, the combination of an event-driven design, detailed enrolment information, and large and valid historical controls creates unique opportunities for investors in Ultimovacs and its clinical trial INITIUM. The cancer vaccine UV1 has the potential to be effective in a wide range of cancers due to its targeting of cells expressing the enzyme telomerase, which is necessary for the survival and growth of 85-90% of cancers. If the results of the trial are positive, it could be a significant advancement in the treatment of malignant melanoma and other types of cancer.

**A significant opportunity exists here that the market has yet to realize.** 

Ultimovacs, the Norwegian biotechnology company developing the universal cancer vaccine UV1, is publicly listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in Norway under the ticker symbol ULTI. The company's current market capitalization is 391,819,791 USD.

**If you have any questions about Ultimovacs or UV1, feel free to ask them in the comment section, and I will try to answer them to the best of my ability.**

If you are interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the company, I recommend reviewing the company presentation available on the company's website ([https://ultimovacs.com/content/2022/12/20221214-Ultimovacs-Company-Presentation.pdf](https://ultimovacs.com/content/2022/12/20221214-Ultimovacs-Company-Presentation.pdf)).

This document provides a wealth of valuable information pertaining to the company's activities and operations. The company is currently conducting clinical studies utilizing a number of leading immunotherapies. Should the vaccine demonstrate the level of efficacy we anticipate in the INITIUM study, there is a likelihood of significant interest from major pharmaceutical companies."

(TSX Venture: ADK, OTCQB: DGNOF), a Canadian company that's pioneering the use of AI to enhance early detection of critical health issues. Their FLAIRE AI platform is noteworthy for its ability to quickly modify and develop applications such as CARA (Computer Assisted Retina Analysis). CARA employs advanced image enhancement algorithms to produce clearer and sharper retinal images, facilitating easier analysis.

CARA stands out as a cost-effective solution for real-time, large-scale patient screening. This makes it a potent tool for areas in urgent need of efficient and accessible eye care services.

Curious to hear your thoughts or if anyone has deeper insights into DIAGNOS and the broader impact of their technology in the healthcare sector."

I've been doing a lot of research on this stock. I can't really explain why it is \*THIS\* low.  Yeah the finacials aren't great but they had a 10m public offering with the drop in november right on the earnings date. it actually covered their debts and losses. on top of what looks like big money getting involved, kind of tells me something is going on. There's a couple times the stock started to tick up and then a massive volume spike nuked it. 

I'm not really sure what to predict the price at. it could go down again, could go to .5 or to a dollar or higher. I almost get GME levels of shorting feeling going on with it.  the volume to float to price are just not making sense without mass shorting being the explanation. I feel like this stock should be easily in the just under a dollar range naturally, which is where it was at the last split. To me, this is one to watch, for sure. I got in yesterday. The stock just does not seem to be even close to what it should be at in my view."

with that recent sabby investment, I kind of wonder if it's being manipulated to lower lows to let them buy up cheaper stock before it breaks out. I can't see this thing falling to zero with the investors they have. it seems artificially low right now. I'll happily take 5k shares at 1 dollar if nothing else, but part of me is hopeful that this is a big one, i'm talking 5+"

I don't think tuesday soon, but considering their stock price at the moment, they could very well give a no news type of response of ""we started our trials and they're so far the data is exceeding our expectations""

I'm a nurse, so I have a little different perspective on GCTK beyond the squeeze I think will happen. I'm pretty sure I'm going to sit in this one long (after the squeeze, i like money) The Device itself would be a big deal for patients, since it's implanted like a pacemaker. So if longevity and accuracy really is on point, it would be a big thing for diabetics. None of the tech is solely new either, the sum of its parts are but CGMs have been around for a while and implants similar to this are not new either. 

Patients have to inject themselves with a sensor on current tech. so this would be a boon in the consumer market. The only downside I see is long term, if it lasts for 2  to 3 years, will it need replaced and what would that look like for patients? First gen tech, so I expect the longevity to go further. This stock is a stock I believe in, BUT I also am aware of the financials surrounding the company are not great. They're a stock I'm staying in but dipping out when dilution and splits occur because of how volatile that would be. 

Right now though, something is  weird with the stock. the volume relative to what it normally sees is crazy high with next to no movement. it's been like that for a while, even in the face of good news.  With a 9m float, a 200m volume of trading should see \*something\* to reflect it, not a 2 cent change."

I’m trying to buy some shares at a SP of $5.50!,july4boygolfer,https://i.redd.it/ktk3qd7xyvu71.jpg,5,,,"Tomorrow morning it will likely shoot up then go down or go down then rise back up. I mean if you can get it at 5.50 tomorrow that's great, but I'd be surprised if it gets that low. Getting in now at this price or anywhere near it is good value regardless of whether or not this squeezes. Safe low risk play as its trading near 52 week low and well below one year price target with a very real potential to go on a squeeze run. My recommendation if you are new to investing is to acquire the shares over a week or so and buy the dips. Buying an entire position all once is only the move when the stock is already shooting to the moon. The best way to guarantee the lowest entry price is to acquire slowly and  average down. If the stock takes off, then go all in, you wont miss much if it does, because if blastoff day is soon then this squeeze is going to be much bigger than any of us originally imagined. More than likely we will see an ebb and flow up and down with a general upward trend until earnings. I suspect this to take off then. Hope this was useful."

A correction is the label given to a smaller dip as opposed to a recession, corrections are not inevitable, they’re not a necessary part of the market cycle. They’re labels given after the fact. This could very well end up being labeled a recession, but until we know the broader picture we treat it as a correction.

It’s also impossible to deny that trump and his different signaling on economic policy, along with curtailing the federal governments workforce is a primary driver of the drop. Tariffs are bad and recent GDP projections dropping due to trumps economic are a huge red flag for the market. Likewise the fact that he’s walked back and delayed big policy events makes markets even less sure where money should be placed. A good president/admin can beat back a recession, Biden did that into a soft landing last term. The price was the inflation which likely saved the economy. Trump however isn’t a good president/admin"

post,2023-04-09 14:22:26,12gku7j,stockstobuytoday,Discussion of Steakholder Food's $STKH Annual Financials,EagleEyeStx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/12gku7j/discussion_of_steakholder_foods_stkh_annual/,13,1.0,0.89,"Last week Steakholder Foods (NASDAQ: STKH) released its annual financial report for 2022. This is a company and sector I’ve been watching for some time now, and over the holiday weekend took the chance to really review the statement and management commentary carefully. After reviewing the data, I remain long on STKH given its significant first-comers advantage in R&D for the key technological infrastructure critical for scaling cellular agriculture for mass consumption globally. Here’s why:

First off, lets start with the obvious. STKH is a pre-revenue company, and 2022 was most certainly not profitable for the company. The lion’s share of their expenses ($9.8M or +29% YoY) went to funding ongoing R&D, accounts for roughly ⅓ of net losses. In contrast, the company did manage to trim its general & administrative expenses by 13%. Regardless, STKH burned through a lot of cash in 2022, which was probably one of the chief reasons they undertook the December ‘22/January ‘23 public round that brought share price to its current range under $1. While this bottom line is not attractive on a short-term horizon, I’ve been adding to my position over recent months given STKH’s average PT of $5.50PT, meaning we’re looking at potential upside of 800%.

https://preview.redd.it/7c00k2wjavsa1.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=357e185f86d9b40c0d69773a72aadf88af9efd86

The management commentary accompanying last week’s financials helped put the company’s current position into perspective. A summary of the key points include:

**Strategic Collabs**

* Collaboration with Singapore’s Umami Meats to penetrate APAC markets with 3D structured, cultivated seafood products.
* Received a $1 million grant for R&D of structured cultivated fish products from Singapore-Israel Industrial R&D Foundation.
* Raised $13 million in two rounds of public offerings ($6.5 million in June 2022 and $6.5 million in January 2023) to fund ongoing research.
* Recently participated in a strategic investment round in Wilk Technologies Ltd. (TASE: WILK) alongside Danone and the Central Bottling Co. Ltd., aimed at advancing the sustainable food solutions landscape worldwide.

**Technological Breakthroughs:**

* Its development of a proprietary 3D bio-printer led to the introduction of Omakase Beef Morsels, a highly marbled, 3D-printed cultivated beef cut.
* STKH’s yield of cell production was boosted by a factor of 50 by leveraging a new filtration system method.
* Demonstrated that cultivated muscle cells have the same nutritional value as beef.
* Developed a temperature-controlled print bed for its industrial-scale printer, a significant step towards mass production for the global market.

**Commercialization Strategy**

* Announced an ambitious accelerated go-to-market strategy for 2023.
* Completed a strategic rebrand to reflect its commitment to cultivating a new community of meat lovers who will participate in the company's mission to make high-quality real meat sustainably.
* Closed its wholly-owned subsidiary, Peace of Meat BV (PoM), as a means to optimize its funds and investment strategy.

**A Growing Intellectual Property Portfolio:**

* Granted its first patent for the physical manipulation of cultured muscle tissue, in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
* Has a portfolio of patent applications awaiting approval, including a provisional patent application for mimicking the texture of cooked fish.
* Received its first registered trademark in Japan.

The way that I see, STKH is carefully laying the groundwork to dominate the intellectual property that will be a must-have for other players hoping to enter the cultivated meat market. Despite their negative bottom line, the value of intangible assets represented by STKH’s first-comers advantage in the cellAg space is priceless. Though cash flow may be tight over the coming months, I remain unequivocally bullish on Steakholder’s long-term potential to be THE dominant player in the future of food technology. LONG."

What are you guys thoughts on KMPH? 

Huge potential market for $KMPH 

The ADHD market was $17.9B in 2019.  Within this the branded portion was $7.4B in 2019, with extended release products representing more than 97% of branded prescriptions. Has an FDA approved adderall type pill for kids. It has extended duration so kids can take it in the morning and it lasts throughout the school day.

$78 million in cash and zero debt 

PT $85

Squeeze the shorts and #SaveTheKids"

The only question has been the timeline for the SP to reflect the actual value of the company. I got in with $70k at approx. $10/average. I’m not interested in selling until at least a year out for tax implications but the past few hours have been entertaining nonetheless. As opposed to other companies that are trading way beyond their technical analysis shows - KMPH is undervalued and is a great bargain for any price below $20.

Also worth noting CVKD was granted FDA fast track designation and orphan drug status for Tecarfarin.

Unmet need & market opportunity for CVKD’s Tecarfarin ($2B annually)

They have a pretty low cash burn between $1M-2M per quarter and they currently have $11.3M cash based on their PR last month on November 7

Also their management team and board of directors has a stacked resume and amazing track records. Not too many investors know about the stock but it’s starting to get picked up. They actually gotten 2 analysts ratings last month so it’s possible we see some additional analyst coverage.

Overall it looks like an amazing play especially at the current levels it’s trading at."

“Sara Rafalson, a vice president at EVgo, a Los Angeles-based charging company that has built chargers in over 35 states, said that the company was seeing its biggest demand growth in Republican-led states like Texas and Florida.”

*EV winter is ending with GM EV Equinox launch June 17th + Costco Discount + EV Blazer Cost Reduction + Stellantis $25K Jeep + many other cheap EV’s 2nd half of this year under, Hertz firesale of EV’s under $25K + $4500 to $7500 incentive

*CEO Insider buy of 125,000 shares 

*Lower interest rates in September combined with many new cheap electric vehicle models like GM Equinox Compact

*Low Debt

*Rolling out North American Charging Standard NACS to entire country so ALL vehicles can recharge at Charging stations

*1,000,000 customers doubling annually (at least, likely more)

*Artificial Intelligence to place charging stations for maximum Charging Revenue

*Renew program to upgrade older stations

*100% USA parts compliant so not affected by China Tariffs and will take business from others

*The US must upgrade its EV infrastructure if they want to compete globally. EVGO is the only fast chargers. BLNK and CHPT only give you one time sales revenue whereas EVGO gives you multiple.

*TESLA backing off of electric vehicle Charging leaves even more room to grow. EVGO is next best at L3 Chargers

*EBIDTA forecast to be positive in early 2025 if not sooner

*Will NOT have to do a secondary offering - line of credit in case, high growth and cash reserves, may not even need it.

*Rates are getting cut soon leading to more growth 

*They expect a DOE loan this year 

*trading sideways right now, perfect entry before the next leg up. Last spike up took 1 month and 1 week of sideways trading. Based off the same timeline, we are a week off. 

*They are adding high end talent, big names from Tesla. Recently hired a CPO, Chief Peoples Officer implying they are expecting to expand rapidly thus need someone with strong connections in the space."

Esp if your account is in the 5k range or smaller. You need to pick only the best of the best trades cause you're already having to risk more like 10% in order to grow your account at a decent rate. 
If youre only risking 1% on a small account you're not gonna get very far. 
You can't continue risking that much tho or the odds will catch up to you.
Pick only the best trades,if you're trading options stay away from 0dte contracts and you can grow your account safely in a pretty fast rate."

post,2022-10-18 08:20:15,y70vkr,stockstobuytoday,Deconstructing Valuation Metrics In The Cybersecurity Sector,darrenfox59,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/y70vkr/deconstructing_valuation_metrics_in_the/,11,0.0,0.93,"2022 has set a particularly tough macro environment for even the best performing tech stocks. From peaking inflation, which has tightened investors’ wallets, to rising interest rates that limit investments in risky avenues such as up-and-coming tech stocks, the tech sector’s performance has been largely underwhelming. Geopolitical tensions caused by the Ukraine-Russia war and global supply chain disruptions due to China lockdowns have further slowed down its performance.

The Nasdaq Composite Index, one of the most widely followed indexes in the world, weighs heavily in the tech stocks to watch. In the second quarter of 2022 the index reported a loss of 22.4%, its worst quarterly performance since 2008. Compared to its all-time high from November 2021, the index corrected over 30% in value YTD. Over the last 7 days, the Tech industry has dropped 4.0%, driven by a pullback from Microsoft of 2.4%. However, the industry is down 32% over the past year. As for the next few years, earnings are expected to grow by 13% per annum. 

Investors are however optimistic about certain dynamic players in the cybersecurity sector, despite the downturns in the broader market. Cybersecurity spending has soared since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Organizations have been faced with new security challenges as cloud computing and remote work have become essential. As a result, many cybersecurity stocks were top performers in 2020 and 2021, boosted by strong demand for next-gen security software. A bear market in 2022 put a damper on some of the highest flyers, but cybersecurity remains a top investment theme.

According to the Identity Theft Resource Center, the number of data breaches set a new record in 2021, with the number of incidents jumping 68% from 2020 and up 23% from the previous high in 2017. Data breaches were up another 14% year-over-year during the first quarter of 2022. Overall, cybercrime is on the rise at a double-digit percentage pace. 

It shouldn’t be surprising that global spending on cybersecurity is expected to exceed $170 billion in 2022 (up about 13% from 2021) and will likely continue to be a high-growth industry for years. Cybersecurity stocks are a red-hot niche of the tech industry, so knowing how to invest in them can yield some big returns in the decade ahead.

Established in 2010 and situated in Clearwater, Florida With a selection of apps including films, games, interactive modules, and more, KnowBe4 offers simulated phishing attacks through the browser. It's crucial to teach employees how to recognize attacks in order to remove the ""human error"" component from a company's attack surface. After receiving more than $300 million in venture capital funding, the business went public in 2021, but since then, the performance of its shares has been a little lackluster, with the price of each share circling about the $20 level (give or take). At a 16X revenue multiple, Vista Equity Partners acquired the company (rev of 290M sold for 4.3 bn). Vista Equity Partners’ offer of $24.90 per share represents a premium of around 44% on KnowBe4’s $17 closing price on September 16, the date at which Vista first made its proposed bid.

HUB Security is a cybersecurity firm that focuses on cutting-edge solutions for safeguarding private and public data. The business unveiled an innovative set of data theft prevention technologies together with an advanced encrypted computing solution designed to thwart hostile hardware intrusions. HUB operates in more than 30 nations and offers a broad spectrum of cybersecurity services in addition to cutting-edge cybersecurity computing products. Similar to KnowBe4, HUB is also set to list on the NASDAQ thanks to the SPAC merger RNER. They are valued at seven times their revenue for their Nasdaq listing as well. With the 16X multiple we saw above for KnowBe4's evaluation, HUB has already stated that they anticipate 115 million in revenue this year. This values them at $1.8 billion.

Currently, they are valued on the TASE at about 670 million ILS, or about 190 million USD in market capitalization. Their SPAC to the NASDAQ is valued at USD 1.25 billion, which is still far less than the 16X multiple. Additionally, this doesn't even take into account the 500 million USD worth of contracts they have signed for the upcoming few years. Which would easily put them at a $3 billion valuation. Because of this, HUB is positioned to grow and is, at the very least, undervalued.

During this bear market, economic worries were a key issue in the technology sector as businesses warned against slowing down spending on advertisements, gadgets, e-commerce, and software. But despite rising interest rates and inflation that has remained close to a 40-year high, demand for cybersecurity services continues to soar. As can be seen, the two outstanding companies in the space are HUB and knowBe4, both of which are undervalued and brimming with promise. Any wise investor keeping an eye on these two should be looking for substantial returns in the near future."

post,2021-12-27 08:39:45,rpiynj,stockstobuytoday,Cyber/Tech Plays ($NET $RDWR $HUB) Innovating Much-Needed DDoS Solutions,OldBay_Trader,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/rpiynj/cybertech_plays_net_rdwr_hub_innovating/,11,0.0,0.93,"**What is a DDoS attack?**

One of the most popular strikes against this industry is DDoS attacks. A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, as the name implies, is a denial of service (DoS) attack that originates from multiple sources simultaneously. A DoS attack is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users. This is accomplished by flooding the target with traffic, or sending it information that triggers a crash making the targeted system unresponsive.

The most common DoS attacks are Buffer Overflow attacks - sending more traffic to a network address than the programmers have bult the system to handle. It includes most attack types, in addition to others that are designed to exploit bugs specific to certain applications or networks. By saturating a targeted server with an overwhelming amount of packets, a malicious actor is able to oversaturate server capacity, resulting in denial-of-service. In order for most DoS flood attacks to be successful, the malicious actor must have more available bandwidth than the target. An attack type in which a memory buffer overflow can cause a machine to consume all available hard disk space, memory, or CPU time. This form of exploit often results in sluggish behavior, system crashes, or other deleterious server behaviors, resulting in denial-of-service.

In the early days of the Internet, websites would exist on individual hosts, and single-source DoS attacks could be effective. Today, this is much less likely; sites are hosted on the cloud and/or across multiple data centers, integrated with CDNs, and so on. Even using techniques such as amplification and reflection, it is very difficult for a single-source attack to have enough bandwidth to overwhelm a modern site’s resources.

**Why it’s hard to defend against DDoS attacks**

Modern security technologies have developed mechanisms to defend against most forms of DoS attacks, but due to the unique characteristics of DDoS, it is still regarded as an elevated threat and is of higher concern to organizations that fear being targeted by such an attack. DDoS attack occurs when multiple systems orchestrate a synchronized DoS attack to a single target. The essential difference is that instead of being attacked from one location, the target is attacked from many locations at once.

**Companies Developing DDoS Solutions for the Financial Sector**

Now that we’ve unpacked what a DDoS attack is and why banks/fintech companies are such a prime target, lets take a look at some of the players developing cutting-edge solutions for future protection:

**CloudFlare (NYSE: NET)** is a leader in the field of web architecture/security with a specialty on DDoS mitigation. The firm went public in September 2019 at a share price of $18. Its stock price has steadily climbed since the IPO, continuing its uptick at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as consumers and companies increasingly turned online. According to recent reviews by both IDC MarketSpace and Forrester, CloudFare has been recognized as an innovator in the field of DDoS prevention and mitigation. CloudFare offers one of the most comprehensive DDoS prevention toolkits on the market, and it is compatible with web applications, network infrastructure, and the IoT. NET is a pretty solid tech investment pick, with a consensus rating of BUY and an average target price of $205 (up from $137). In other words, this is an established player in the cyber solutions market with a reputation that precedes itself and forecasts for strong upside moving into 2022.

**RadWare (NASDAQ: RDWR)** is another household name in the world of net/data security. This Israeli-American company has created a niche for itself in the space of cyber security and application delivery solutions for applications in physical, virtual, cloud, and software defined data centers worldwide. One of their flagship products is DefensePro, which provides automated DDoS protection from fast-moving, high-volume, encrypted or very-short-duration threats. RadWare has been workin with leading players in the financial services and banking industries for nearly a decade, and its DefensePro is considered a “gold standard” for anti-DDoS solutions. Notwithstanding a recent downgrade from overperforming to performing by Oppenheimer, RDWR holds a BUY consensus after gaining nearly 30% in share value over the past month alone. Definitely another DDoS prevention provider to keep tabs on.

**HUB Security (TASE: HUB)** is an Israeli player that has surged in 2021. From their merger with ALD in February to their $22M acquisition of ComSec global in September to their recent declaration of intent for a NASDAQ listing, HUB is fast becoming a disruptor in the confidential computing field. They recently clinched deals with three European national banks for a DDoS simulation platform designed to up readiness and defensive protocol. More specifically, their D.Storm product is a system that collects data from the bot attacks in real-time and presents it to the user for in-depth analysis. In essence, D.Storm provides actionable intelligence to banks and fintech actors that they need to manage the risks in the face of an increasingly sophisticated threat landscape. Though listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, HUB is on my watchlist for the anticipated NASDAQ listing and the significant value-multiplier it will entail for HUB’s enterprise value.

This went on a bit longer than expected, but I hope readers who made it to the bottom have a better idea of what a DDoS attack is, why they are particularly worrisome for the financial services sector, and who some of the big names working on mitigation solutions are. I’m a tech investor and not a financial advisor, so DYOR. And Happy New Years kiddos, stay warm and wear a mask."

Through a tech enhancement and value-added acquisition, Nano Dimension is pioneering an exciting growth market. Investors can either watch from the sidelines or position themselves to capitalize on this multi-year opportunity.

If there was ever a ground-floor market growth opportunity, the 3D printing market would be it. According to Decisive Market Insights, the global 3D printed electronics market is projected to reach a whopping $21.8 billion by the year 2026.

Without a doubt, Nano Dimension is preparing to innovate and even dominate in this expanding field. As evidence of this, Nano Dimension introduced its next-generation DragonFly LDM 2.0 system. This is top-tier technology for 3D printing enthusiasts and businesses alike.

BMEA & LOVE are two tickers to check out, as they are on the verge of a potential squeeze. BMEA has a current short float around 50% and LOVE has a short float around 30%. Both are also under even min PT's

NKLA is speculative.. but with a short float above 25%, currently on Reg sho list, a market cap below 100K, and analyst PT's well above the current $1 share price (ave PT is $14)... NKLA could see a big rally run as ppl start to cover due to nuclear gaining a lot of interest across the board.

ARTW meets criteria to do something very similar. It being the only low float stock in the agriculture sector trading viciously under book value, and being cash flow positive I think this could be the next multi bagger move like the rest listed above. 

This stock has a credit facility and no r/s history making it a safe bet with minimal dilution worries. They are looking fund organic growth and not raise additional capital.

So she has me going with her to the store and picking up the most obscure things. Sometimes they are good and some not so good. She recently had me pick up this environmentally friendly cardboard packed water called Flow water. To be honest it was a little more expensive than traditional water but it really was good (i'm a big water drinker) and if it's better for the environment that's just a bonus. But I started to think of the price vs the cost to make.

So I looked into the company more and found out they were traded publicly on the TSX. Curiosity got the better of me as I started looking into their PR’s and saw they had massive revenue increases as well as a recent partnership with Live Nation. But I concluded they were making a ton of money and definitely tasted a lot better than Dasani or Aquafina.

**Workhorse Group. (WKHS)** can be found in a similar setup to the **Volkswagen (VWAGY)** Short Squeeze of ‘08.

For those of you who don’t know, **Volkswagen (VWAGY)** had one of the largest, most costly, and unforeseeable short squeezes in history. From a starting price of **€210.85 ($249.83)** to **€1005 ($1,190.69)** in less than two days, briefly making it the most valuable company in the world...

Now let’s try to enhance this perspective, in 2008 we were in the midst of what was known as *The Great Recession.* The worst financial disaster since *The Great Depression.* The World Equity Markets were in a progressively worsening situation across 2008. For example, two of the largest single day percentage drops in the **S&P 500 INDEX** were in 2008. **1)** *10/15/08*: -9.04% **2)** *12/01/08:* \-8.93%.

In 2008 the auto industry as a whole was in a rough state because it is a *Cyclical Stock,* so it moves depending on economic confidence. So, when the state of the economy is “good” it goes up, when the state of the economy is “bad” it generally goes down. Of course, in a financial crisis people are not buying cars because they have to be conservative with their money and put food on the table knowing there is so much uncertainty within the economy. With this consistent drop of the auto industry, it turned big auto companies in the world that are on every stock exchange into sexy, attractive short candidates. With that being said, of course **Volkswagen** was one of those candidates. 

**Volkswagen** at the time, was in some pretty serious debt, but consistently reported quarterly growth. With consistent earnings in a troubling time, **Volkswagen** managed to keep the stock price around **€300 ($355).**

*Ten years ago, amidst the worst financial crises since the Great Depression, the American auto industry almost died. By Fall 2008, the “Big Three” US car companies of General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford faced potential insolvency, and without swift government intervention, their futures were in doubt.* \- **Business Insider**

**General Motors (GM)** was the biggest automaker in the world for about 72 years which they then had to file for bankruptcy on June 1, 2009. This is just perspective as to how bad the auto industry was in 2008, now I’m not saying it’s just as bad in 2021 but let me put the pieces together as to why this relates to **Workhorse.**

The downfall of the auto industry seemed like a no-brainer to short sellers to make boatloads of cash from struggling companies that were on the verge of bankruptcy. It was looked at as an “easy win”, “easy money.” “Let’s profit off of it, let’s short these companies!” 

Like I said earlier the auto industry was getting wrecked, so you can only imagine how luxury car companies are doing in this financial crisis as well. **Porsche** was fighting bankruptcy, just like every other car company was in 2008. Who the hell is buying a Porsche in a recession? Prior to 2008, **Porsche** was already a shareholder in **Volkswagen,** and as 2008 progressed, **Porsche** cleverly increased their holdings in **Volkswagen. Porsche** had increased their position to **30%,** then **44%** in *October 2008.* **Porsche** was holding **44%** in shareholder equity, but they also held Options for an additional **30%,** which gives a total of **74%** of **Volkswagen** shares. Very clever move…

It was estimated that the *short interest* in Volkswagen was only **12.80%.** In today’s market that doesn’t seem too noteworthy (Workhorse’s *Short Interest*: **39%**). Now, since **Porsche** owned practically 75% of **Volkswagen** share equity, it went from the market assuming that there is an available *Float* of **45%** to all of a sudden realizing there is a *Float* of not even **%1** of outstanding shares. 

*With more than 70% of Volkswagen stock controlled by Porsche, short sellers realized there was nothing available to cover bearish bets. There was no stock float. All, or most, of Volkswagen shares were accounted for. The door shorts had to run through to exit their positions turned out to be microscopic.* ***-  Baaron’s***

When there is such little *Float* available on the market, when people are expecting there to be so much MORE *Float* then there initially is, it creates a Supply and Demand issue. And that’s exactly what **Porsche** knew was going to happen, a Supply and Demand issue. All of the short sellers needed to immediately ‘Buy to Close’ their positions in **Volkswagen.** Millions of shares worth of **Volkswagen** needed to be purchased but there were just not enough shares to be issued out and sold. When there is a ton of demand, very little supply, the price of the supply inflates like crazy. And that inevitably became the **Volkswagen** Short Squeeze of ‘08.

Over the span of this historical short squeeze the price of **Volkswagen** ended up breaking **€1005 ($1,190.69).** In the midst of the greatest financial crisis in the last 50 years, **Volkswagen** (very briefly) became the most valuable company in the entire world. That is the potential of a well engineered short squeeze… 

**Porsche**, the Hedge Fund that also makes cars, made 30 billion dollars in a few *short* weeks. (Pun intended) 

Now, how does this relate to **Workhorse**?

Let me put this in perspective…

**Volkwagen’s Short Interest:** *12.80%*

**Workhorse’s Short Interest:** *39%*

**Workhorse’s Float:** *115 Million*

**Workhorse’s Outstanding Shares:** *123 Million* 

The *Short Interest* for Workhorse is 3x greater than **Volkwagen’s** Short Interest was in 2008, the main message here is to **OWN THE FLOAT!!!**

**IF WE OWN THE FLOAT, WE CAN SQUEEZE THIS LEMON!!!**

It is better to buy shares than call options and I know we all want to print tendies, but owning and not selling the *Float* will be a better scenario for all of us, so we aren’t YOLOing ‘out of the money’ call options to donate our cash to Wall Street or Robinhood. In order for us to make this horse gallop, we must own the float, let **Porsche** be a great reminder that retail investors can have just as much of an impact on a specified stock than any hedge fund can. 

LET’S SQUEEZE THIS LEMON!!! THIS HORSE WILL SOON GALLOP!!!

**WORKHORSE FOR THE WIN!!!**"

Renewing interest in the Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) sector with its success, E3 is ushering in a ""new era"" for both the province and DLE-focused companies. (Source: [https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/alberta-enters-global-lithium-race-with-opening-of-first-extraction-pilot-project-1.1968555](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/alberta-enters-global-lithium-race-with-opening-of-first-extraction-pilot-project-1.1968555)) 

**Another challenger in the industry has arisen in the form of Volt Lithium (VLT.v VLTLF, 35M Market Cap), breaking out due to the renewed DLE interest, a ""growing, pure-play lithium development and technology company, aiming to be North America's first commercial producer of lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonates from oilfield brine""**

In this Streetwise Reports Article, Michael Ballanger of GGM Advisory cited VLT as a game-changing lithium find amid the escalating demand for lithium and essential battery metals driven by electric vehicle manufacturing, stemming from VLT's innovative IES-300 DLE technology: [https://www.streetwisereports.com/article/2023/08/22/volt-lithium-a-life-changing-find.html](https://www.streetwisereports.com/article/2023/08/22/volt-lithium-a-life-changing-find.html)  

Designed to extract lithium from oilfield brines, VLT's DLE technology boasts an impressive lithium recovery rate, reaching 90% from concentrations as low as 34 mg/L and remarkable 97% recoveries using 120 mg/L concentrations, all while maintaining commercial viability. 

By removing contaminants from oilfield brine to use in their DLE technology, VLT additionally offers a compelling opportunity to oil and gas operators, presenting a win-win situation by adding value to existing oilfield operations.

Further emphasizing VLT's potential is its Rainbow Lake Project which showcases a substantial lithium resource of 4.3 million tonnes with concentrations reaching up to 121mg/L. On track to release a PEA for Rainbow Lake this year, VLT is aiming to produce 1,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide by the end of June 2025.

Fortified by a recent financing round of approximately $6.8M, VLT is equipped with the necessary capital required to execute its focus, including the implementation of its DLE production method by the second half of 2024 at its Rainbow Lake Property.

post,2023-02-19 14:33:32,116c6le,stockstobuytoday,Confidential Computing Breakthroughs Signal a LT Opportunity for $HUBC $MSFT $INTC Investors,OldBay_Trader,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/116c6le/confidential_computing_breakthroughs_signal_a_lt/,9,0.0,0.92,"Advances in the field of confidential computing is proving to be a major force for cyber security and data security innovation across multiple industries. Confidential computing uses encryption, hardware-level isolation, and trusted execution environments (TEEs) to protect sensitive data while it is being used or processed. This new technology promises enhanced levels of privacy, safety, and control over digital assets that were previously impossible with traditional cloud computing infrastructure. 

A recent report from market intelligence firm Everest Group states that “confidential compute has rapidly become an essential component of any enterprise cybersecurity strategy."" The report goes on to note that investments made by these leading providers are ""likely undervalued"" compared to the gains they'll produce over coming years - suggesting now could be an ideal time for investors interested in capitalizing on this emerging space. 

The same report highlights several key trends driving growth within the sector: increasing pressures from regulatory bodies such as GDPR; rising demand for AI/ML applications; growing awareness amongst businesses about the importance of protecting their data assets; improving accessibilities thanks to open source initiatives like Open Enclave SDK; more cost effective solutions becoming available due advances such as Intel SGX technology; increased adoption rates amongst cloud providers including Amazon Web Services (AWS); etc.. In short – it seems clear that momentum behind confidential compute is only going increase moving forward.  

https://preview.redd.it/ti4qpc55i5ja1.png?width=1185&format=png&auto=webp&s=15461d61bd7d05f3e90b1c5dfd6715673a9f3d28

Three of the major players in this field include HUB Security (reserved NASDAQ: HUBC), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). For tech investors, these companies have multi-bagger potential over a intermediate-to-long term horizon. $HUBC hails from Israel, and is in the final stages of completing a SPAC-listing via RNER. HUB specializes in creating zero-trust hardware and software solutions that leverage military-grade technology for air-tight data security. Its NASDAQ valuation is earmarked at $1.28b, translating into an initial offering of $10/share. The date of listing is slated for February 28th, so this is a name that most certainly belongs on your watchlist. 

Microsoft and Intel, two mainstays of the global computing industry, are also driving innovation in confidential computing. MSFT offers the use of confidential computing hardware components for Azure, which is considered one of the leading cloud providers worldwide. Mark Russinovich, Chief Technical Officer of Microsoft Azure, recently revealed the new set of virtual machines for cloud-based operations that are equipped with encryption keys which cannot be exported and stored in secure spaces known as Trusted Execution Environments (TEE). These TEEs function like black boxes that store encrypted data inside a protected space only accessible to authorized users. The data can only be accessed if the proper credentials are used.

Intel isn't far behind in the race for innovation in confidential computing. Intel recently unveiled its 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable Processors and the Intel Max Series CPUs and GPUs, together with a virtual machine (VM) isolation solution called “Intel Trust Domain Extension (TDX),” as well as an independent trust verification service. This establishes what is claimed to be the industry's most comprehensive confidential computing portfolio. TDX has been developed to defend data stored in VMs inside a trusted execution environment that is segregated from the hardware below it. Consequently, cloud service providers will not have access to information processed within this TEE.

These three companies are blue chip tech players that have dominated the cyber security space for years. With the advent of confidential computing, new investment opportunities for tech veterans are cropping up, and its just a matter of gaining some exposure to the new cutting-edge domain of data and net sec."

post,2021-10-04 14:39:49,q16qtc,stockstobuytoday,Top Trending Stocks on Reddit,utradea,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/q16qtc/top_trending_stocks_on_reddit/,8,2.0,0.77,"Hey Everyone,

Wanted to provide an update for the top trending tickers on Reddit last week. It is interesting seeing if sentiment is a leading or lagging indicator, as well as the correlation to price. The dashboard is a work in progress but so far it has been useful for me to track trending stocks and be able to see new tickers on the leaderboard - before they become too popular.

Dashboard and Trending Stocks

Before we jump in, I wanted to provide a bit of background. This is a work in progress so I want to be transparent with how we are tracking these trends. If you have any thoughts on how I can make this more useful please let me know.

**Tracking Mechanics**

* The algorithm pulls data from multiple subreddits using the reddit API. The subreddits it is pulling from are non-stock specific subreddits (i.e. WBS, investing, stockmarket, pennystocks, etc.)
* It then plots mentions with price over a give timeframe (Right now you can look at 72hrs, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month)
* We also display sentiment, number of posts, comments, and upvotes. Sentiment is determined using Spacy and a text classification dictionary

**Why did we build this?**

* We wanted a way to track social sentiment across a number of social media platforms. Studies show that sentiment can impact the price of a stock and we wanted to see if there is a way to leverage this and provide it to individual investors. The more you know, the better.
* Allows you to see the overall trends, and the quickly drill into the posts to validate the content.

**Future plans**

* **Twitter (Beta)** \- currently testing a way to capture twitter sentiment. I think there is opportunity to follow and track what a number of the largest Fintwit accounts discus and corelate to the price movement of smaller cap stocks. This is my hypothesis but I need to test it.
* **Social Trend Score -** ultimately we want to be able to identify trending ticker before the price takes off, or before it drops - we are planning on incorporating data from multiple social platform

Top 10 Trending Stocks on Reddit

The screenshot is pulled from the Social Sentiment Dashboard and shows the top trending tickers in the last 72hrs.

**CEI -** **Camber Energy, Inc.**, an independent oil and natural gas company, engages in the acquisition, development, and sale of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGL) in the Cline shale and upper Wolfberry shale in Glasscock County, Texas. **2 weeks ago this was sitting at number 18 on the leaderboard**. It was getting a lot of traction on twitter and started to get more mentions on Reddit. It is now sitting at #4 on on top trending tickers. Over this time period the price increased close to 200%. I will need to look at this further but if I look back at the data it might be a good my to test the hypothesis.

**SDC - SmileDirectClub, Inc**. operates as an oral care company. It offers clear aligner therapy treatment. This has been in the top 5 over the last 2 weeks. There have been a significant number of posts and mentions on WSB for SDC - a lot of DD floating around. A month ago it was sitting at #17, and then 2 weeks ago was #1 and was at $6.90 per share. Since that peak 2 weeks ago the pricedeclined \~25% but the mentions and social sentiment has remained strong.

**Other Thoughts**

The other tickers you see are ones that are usually on the leaderboard (AMC, GME, TSLA, QQQ, etc.) which is why it is useful to see what tickers are up and coming on the trend list. This leads me to another thought, it might be useful to be able to filter out certain tickers.

**TLDR**; Track trending tickers on Reddit and potentially catch a ticker before the price hits a peak. The view also provides a way to quickly drill into potentially new tickers or stocks, and find the associated DD.

post,2021-09-10 05:00:46,plegi3,stockstobuytoday,KAVL on the climb with a ton of potential,TheMofunkinWolf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/plegi3/kavl_on_the_climb_with_a_ton_of_potential/,12,0.0,1.0,"KAVL has been taking off over the last couple of days. I think there is still a lot of potential. Here is my write up with sources. 

Background:  KAVL is a public US company. They distribute Bibi Sticks and Bidi Pouches (Product line about to launch soon). The reason the company is structured like this is because Bidi is a foreign manufacturer of vape / tobacco products. It is against US regulations for a foreign manufacturer of these type of products to distribute directly in the US. So KAVL being public in the US is allowed to distribute in the US.  


1. Kaival Brands Innovations Group Inc. is poised To Benefit From Ongoing Shift Away From Combustible Tobacco Products:   
\- To summarize, KAVL has been extremely diligent, making sure their product passes FDA regulation. Many of their competitors fail to do this. It is my assumption that the FDA grants grace periods for new vape products entering the market. Many companies pump during their grace period, then dissolve and restructure. You have seen this with Puff >Fume and other similar companies. KAVL has built their company around making sure they meet FDA regulations so they can build their product and brand.

4. They took a hit after the last Quarterly Reporting.   
 ""Kaival Brands recognizes revenue in two ways, which is similar to other consumer product brands. Typically, the Company will receive an order from a retailer or distributor and subsequently ship from its fulfilment center. Under typical payment terms, Kaival Brands receives payment for the product at the time the customer obtains control of the products. In addition, the Company has some contracts with 120-day payment terms, which is common practice when working with larger wholesalers and distributors. With respect to these types of orders, Kaival Brands fulfills and ships the entire product order upfront to the distributor, and then receives payment for products upon sale of the product by the wholesale or distributor, as applicable, payable on a recurring monthly basis. This payment cycle lasts 120-days. Our most recent orders with 120-day terms, represents an aggregate of approximately $41.6 million, were placed in April 2021 by GSW and C-Store Master. Despite these orders being placed in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, revenue recognition rules require us to recognize revenues once the product sells, or payment is received, of which there can be no assurance.""

5. They have a focus on the China Market and are in 11 other countries.  
 Bidi® Vapor has also been granted two patents in China, which Kaival Brands/Bidi® Vapor view as vital to competing in the world's largest vaping market. The companies have applied for additional patents in the United States and abroad that will expand their IP moat and enhance their reputation for innovation in the fast-growing vape pen market, which Facts & Figures expects to reach $45 billion by 2026.

Price is near it's historical bottom. Gap up looks like it could be in order. Short interest took a huge dive on Friday (without upward action which is key point), and it's peak short interest came sometime in the period where the price went up before the cliff. I think they've already profited as much as they will, so they will eventually close out, causing a nice little ramp (and gap up)"
post,2021-08-27 18:08:25,pcspou,stockstobuytoday,"MKTY, the undiscovered biggest competitor of Riot and Mara",Dylanbos33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/pcspou/mkty_the_undiscovered_biggest_competitor_of_riot/,11,0.0,1.0,"&#x200B;

With bitcoin rising again, miners have been in a tailwind. Given high valuations of MARA and RIOT, I've been looking at under-the-radar companies operating in miners industry.

I found out that MKTY was pretty interesting. They don't operate as RIOT and MARA.

**MKTY Edge:**

* Operates at lower cost than MARA, and 4x cheaper than RIOT
* Managed by a PE firm
* Is more likely to be resilient to volality, since they sell their the currency mined
* Currently operating a 2.6 MW Facility in Washington State, and plans to expand to 53MW by end of the year. All their equipment has been bought from another miner bankruptcy from a few years ago (→ not subject to shortage equipment as opposed to any other competitor)  

* **Unconscionably low valuation – 3.5x EV/EBITDA and 28% FCF yield based on 1Q’22 run-rate**  
**1Q’22 run-rate guidance may be highly conservative based on recent developments**  
**Aligned and incentivized CEO with an impressive background in Private Equity**  
**Significant embedded upside optionality (ESG, SOTP, BTC price and strategic alternatives)**  
**Several catalysts to potentially make excess returns in the very near term (< 3 month*****s)***

**Cost to mine**

* **MKTY energy cost: 0.024$ / KwH**
* Mara energy cost: 0.028$ / KwH
* Riot energy cost: 0.08$ / KwH (historial energy cost)

**Currently trading at an heavy discount compared to MARA and RIOT**

* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of RIOT : 423x
* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MARA: 995x
* **Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MKTY: 12x**

**Why is MKTY under-the-radar?**

* Recently uplisted on the Nasdaq
* Small Market Cap ($120mm)
* Management team focussing on execution rather than PR
* Low float & high insider ownership (40%)
* Low volume (about 90k shares / day)

**Conclusion** MKTY sounds like a company to keep an eye on given all these reasons.

post,2023-04-20 12:34:53,12sx8dt,stockstobuytoday,A List of Biotech Stocks With Major Price Movement and Continued Upside Potential.,ThePharmacyInvestor,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/12sx8dt/a_list_of_biotech_stocks_with_major_price/,10,0.0,1.0,"Here is a list of stocks that have seen big price movement recently with continued upside potential. 

EYPT: When I first called out this stock, it was trading only a few cents away from 52-week lows indicating that it was severely undervalued and a reversal was due soon. I was correct, the reversal was the exact day that I called out this stock. The stock has gone up over 100% just in the last thirty days meaning that perhaps it is somewhat overextended. However, this 100% increase over the last month was stimulated by the fact that there was about a 20% increase on March 27th when the company released news that they had completed enrollment in oversubscribed phase 2 DAVIO 2 clinical trial of EYP-1901 for maintenance treatment of wet AMD. This clearly shows that investors and the market are excited for what’s to come.

ALDX: The stock for this company is trading way higher than its 52-week lows; in fact, it’s reaching its 52-week highs which may indicate that the catalyst is priced in. However, as always, biotech stocks are unpredictable. If this drug gets approved with minor restrictions and it’s marketed and produced correctly, this could be a huge long term winner for the company.

ICPT: This companies stock price is up almost 60% in the last 3 weeks without any major news being released. This indicates that this is simply a build-up to the catalyst which raises the following question: Is this catalyst priced in? There is a larger than normal chance that this catalyst is priced in because it is trading near 52 week highs after extending upwards 60% over the short time period of 3 weeks. This means that there is a possibility of the advisory meeting being a sell off. This stock is unique however because there are two plays with this one company: the Advisory Meeting and the FDA Approval. If the advisory meeting is a sell off event, that will greatly increase the chances of a big jump on FDA approval, especially considering the magnitude of this catalyst and that it is revolutionary for its market. However, if the advisory meeting does see the stock jump up in price (in my opinion, I am leaning towards a sell off), then perhaps the FDA approval will be a sell off event.

IBRX: This stock has been beat down quite heavily over the last few months but it has just undergone a very strong reversal. In the last 5 days alone, the stock has went up more than 50%. However, if you look at the chart, you will realize that this is still nothing compared to its potential. The FDA approval is upcoming in a little over a month and if the stock remains this undervalued by the time the FDA approval comes along (and the FDA approves the drug of course), there is a huge amount of upside potential!

In light of this, keeping an eye on quantum computing stocks, supercomputer tokens, and distributed computing cryptocurrencies could be worthwhile. 

What Is Quantum Computing? Computers that use quantum theory are the main component of this technology field. This method of estimation essentially indicates that quantum computers will be able to outperform today’s state-of-the-art supercomputers and will represent the most disruptive innovation in tech since the advent of computers.  

Given this vast long-term potential for the field, here are a few players I for one am slapping onto my watchlist for a proper entry:

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)

Market Cap \~ $378.8 Billion

Sector – Communication Services

Price – $151.52

Nvidia is a chip and computing stock that has taken the world by storm. Its products are employed in expanding markets such as the gaming, data center, automotive, and professional visualization sectors. With its graphics processing units (GPUs), which boost computational capacity, NVIDIA is swiftly becoming the world leader in cutting-edge semiconductor designs, powering the next generation of technology.

IonQ (NYSE: IONQ)

Market Cap \~ $913 Million

Sector – Industrials

Price – $4.61

IonQ just went public through a combination with the unique purpose acquisition company (SPAC) dMY Technology Group III. The first pure-play quantum computer business to go public is IonQ, a start-up in the quantum computing industry. Will use the cash gained from the SPAC merger to fund the construction of a network of quantum computers that will be accessible through various cloud services. IonQ has partnerships with Microsoft, Google Cloud, and Amazon’s Web Services to demonstrate the company’s focus on cloud computing. In addition to investing in IonQ, the Japanese telecoms major and tech investor Softbank Group has partnered with the firm to use quantum computing to power the many other tech firms in its portfolio.

HUB (TASE:HUB.TA) 

Market cap-$604.64M 

Sector-cybersecurity 

Price- 515.70 NIS 

HUB Cyber Security (Israel) was founded in 2017 by former members of the Israeli Defense Forces' special intelligence units. The company specializes in cutting-edge cyber-security solutions that safeguard confidential government and commercial data. In addition to presenting a brand-new set of data theft protection technologies, the company introduced an advanced encrypted computing solution designed to thwart hostile intrusions at the hardware level. A global provider of cutting-edge cybersecurity computing products and a broad range of cybersecurity services with operations in over 30 nations.

As seen in the chart, HUB (+27.12% YTD) is far-outperforming its sectoral peers as quantum computing has recently taken off in the last couple of months, and despite recent double-digit declines in tech. For instance, mega  IT firms such as MSFT (-16.65% YTD), APPL (-7% YTD), YOJ (-38.94% YTD), and META (-49.38% YTD) have all underperformed in comparison to HUB. This is the case as well for sectorial peers like IONQ (-63% YTD) and NVDA (-39.50% YTD, likewise fall far short of the YTD gains of HUB. HUB has outperformed relative to the Nasdaq baseline QQQ  by about 48%, demonstrating just how bullish this stock is in the face of an extended bear market.

As quantum computing has applications to nearly every industry, including military defense and biowarfare, governments have increased spending in an effort not to fall behind competing countries. So far, the European Union and the United States have pledged $7.2 billion and $1.3 billion respectively, with China having announced a whopping $15 billion in planned government funding. Although quantum computing is still in its infancy, significant research funding is being invested in this cutting-edge technology. Even though there aren’t many pure-play quantum equities yet, investing in tech behemoths that have exposure to the field could pay off handsomely in the coming"

post,2021-12-26 13:48:34,rox9h1,stockstobuytoday,International IoT Disruptor Plays $ALRM $TRAC,_Analystica,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/rox9h1/international_iot_disruptor_plays_alrm_trac/,8,1.0,0.84,"IoT Security Innovators that are Worth the Watch

The IoT revolution is nothing new. It has actually been with us for quite a while now. And while it has tremendous market growth potential, at this point it seems like the good companies are already well established and over priced. But rest assured, there are still a couple of hidden gems out there that are only at the very beginning of their business evolution. Luckily, they also hold great potential for becoming serious disruptors and make innovative use of the IoT. 

The IoT (internet of things) is simply a fancy name referring to online networks of devices that are connected to the internet and are communicating with other devices in the same network via connections to data centres. Think of smart light bulbs that you can turn on using a phone app or a smart house where you can control lights, music, locks, etc. online. These are all examples of IoT based developments. 

More recently, new IoT companies are moving away from just focusing on connectivity and go further into application development, platform hosting and other services. With innovation growing, the IoT sector attracted nearly $20B last year and new startups are popping by everywhere and in 2020 attracted around 70% of total investments in IoT. Just in 2020, the IoT market grew by 20% (currently estimated at $300B) and this trend is projected to continue with a 25% CAGR in the next 5-7 years. And with market projections this positive, I’ve done some digging to try and find some of these companies that I believe are still undervalued and hold the potential to double down fast. 

[Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) (NASDAQ: ALRM) 

Founded in 2000, [Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) develops cloud-based home or business security systems that are already used in millions of homes across the US and Canada. The system enables users to control their home or business devices (security cameras, lights, locks, air conditioning, etc.) through an internet based app. Alarm provides customers with its SaaS software and currently has over 100M devices connected to its data servers. In the past two years, Alarm also broadened its connectivity to include cars, cameras and water valves. 

ALRM’s market cap is currently valued at $4.1B with a share price ranging between $73-108 and an average volume of 188K. In terms of stock price action, the past 3 weeks has seen a modest 2.2% increase. While this seems to be a minor share price increase, market projections are highly positive for smart home security and ALRM’s connectivity seems to provide a solid starting point.    

T42 (AIM:TRAC)

Similarly to what Alarm is doing with house security, T42 is providing security solutions to the maritime shipping industry, which is currently lagging far behind what cutting-edge tech can offer. In a bid to address this market gap enter T42, an IoT, satellite-based technology company that provides tracking solutions for maritime shipping containers. T42 develops and manufactures a state-of -the-art smart lock that monitors containers and transmits real time data about security hazards to clients. T42’s lock provides real time data and alerts (saved on the company’s cloud server), monitoring containers’ location, humidity levels, temperature, impacts, door openings etc. 

T42 is still in its early stages as a company, with a market cap of $8.6M GBP average volume estimated at 350K. Last week, T42 announced a $40M deal with Latin American ports which led to a 100% jump in share price jumping within a single trading session. And while T42 is still a new player in the field of IoT, its market projections are also highly positive and seeing deals starting to flow in sets it on a great course.  

Other than ALRM and TRAC, there seems to be an analyst consensus about larger companies such as Cisco (CSCO), Amazon (AMZN) and Garmin (GRMN). I still need to do my proper DD on the large caps ones, but for those of you interested in some innovative IoT small caps, ALRM and TRAC have the potential to solidify as future security leaders each in its own field. I’ll keep an eye out, hope you will too. I’m not an adviser of course, so make sure to do your own research. Happy holidays!"

The fact is that “Syfovre” is FDA approved and only 6 people had this issue out of 60000 !!!
And it is mentioned on the site that this might be a possible side effect.
If you were to punish every pharma for 1/10000 side effect by over 60%+ you would bankrupt all of them.
In any case, we will get official reaction in a few days when they have the shareholders meeting.
I bought some yesterday and more today, the volume was huge so am guessing the bounce to the upside will be pretty good too,
Just look at “T” ATT, and that was a real concern, but still it popped. 
Shorts squeeze soon to come I think
But dont take my word for it, do your own research to make sure"

(NASDAQ: MTNB) is another great opportunity to look out for because of its amazing upside potential! This company is looking to present its phase 2 findings on April 18, 2023 for Oral amphotericin b (MAT2203) also known as the (EnACT) study which treats Cryptococcal meningitis, a condition with a market that is expected to reach more than $7 billion by the end of 2027!

All patients treated with MAT2203 who completed the induction phase achieved **sterile** CSF cultures during treatment (either during induction or early consolidation phases).

* There was no evidence of breakthrough or relapsed cryptococcal infections observed in any of the patients during treatment with MAT2203 through 10 weeks.
* In Cohort 2, overall survival was 95% in 40 patients randomized to receiving MAT2203.
* More in the article...

Foreseeable future of the companies fundamentals!

* The company is forecast to break even in 2025 (within the next three years which is considered above average market growth)
* Full year 2022 EPS and revenue exceeded analyst expectations
* Very high growth revenue (more than double the market)
* The companies short term and long term liabilities are far less than their short term and long term assets.

(Multi-bagger potential) Part 2,Ultimovacs4ever,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/10vcz6k/universal_cancer_vaccine_with_very_promising/,6,1.0,0.81,"A few weeks ago, I shared information regarding the INITIUM study conducted by Ultimovacs, which demonstrated a substantial increase in progression-free survival compared to historical controls. Additional details on this matter can be accessed at the following link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/10c1ane/universal\_cancer\_vaccine\_with\_very\_promising/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/10c1ane/universal_cancer_vaccine_with_very_promising/)

In line with the full recruitment of [NIPU](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04300244) study on January 23rd, I would like to present an update on the event probability analysis for this study. The accompanying graph displays the enrolment progress for NIPU as reported by the company and compared to a proxy representation of Covid-19 intensity in Norway. As depicted, enrolment has remained consistent throughout the duration of this period.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sc4w80yhkmga1.png?width=614&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b4188155e7599948252f4e666b18eea5cfea483

The NIPU study is an event-driven clinical trial with 118 participants, divided into two arms of 59 individuals each. Both arms receive a combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab, while the experimental arm also receives UV1.

The accompanying plot presents the probability of various events, based on the assumption that the population follows the reference study (CheckMate-743). The PFS readout for the study is at 69, with a threshold of no effect set at 34 events and a significant effect defined as 40 events. The plot suggests a high likelihood that 34 events have already been achieved, and at present, there is approximately a 50% probability that 37 events have been achieved. This equates to a theoretical hazard ratio (HR) of approximately 0.8, as indicated in the HR plot shown later in this update. The probability of a significant result surpasses 50% computationally, starting from mid-March 2023.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ehu0fv9xulga1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e8f225f43dd46d0b81b6f40e4cb83df3bc7869b

Theoretical HR-ratio for NIPU:

The last plot compares the results of the INITUM (CM511) and NIPU (CM743) studies. The plot suggests a high likelihood of UV1 having a positive effect in the INITUM study and that the probability of UV1 having an effect in the NIPU study is rapidly increasing.

**A significant opportunity exists here that the market has yet to realize.**

Ultimovacs, the Norwegian biotechnology company developing the universal cancer vaccine UV1, is publicly listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in Norway under the ticker symbol ULTI. The company's current market capitalization is 424 970 955 USD.

**If you have any questions about Ultimovacs or UV1, feel free to ask them in the comment section, and I will try to answer them to the best of my ability.**

This randomized, multi-center phase II study evaluated the efficacy of  the universal cancer vaccine UV1 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors ipilimumab and nivolumab as a second-line treatment for mesothelioma. Sponsored by Oslo University Hospital and supported by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Ultimovacs, the trial enrolled 118 patients, with half receiving the combination treatment and half receiving nivolumab and ipilimumab alone. The primary objective of the study is to determine whether the combination of UV1, ipilimumab, and nivolumab leads to a clinically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) after progression on first-line standard platinum doublet chemotherapy."

Be careful investing in companies that are extremely high PE and low cash flow.

I'm a Banking & Finance student and I want to help you by analyzing your favorite stocks.

Write in the comments the tickers you want me to analyze and I'll do them ASAP.

I'll publish the analyses on my YouTube channel called Hustle Hub (because it would be pretty hard to show you all the information that I find in a single Reddit post).

P.S. If this post gets deleted, I will lose the comments as well, so if I were you, I would also comment on the channel!"

This potential looming bad news turned out to be not so bad an a net positive by reducing the float. 

The options chain for next week is fucking retarded. 500k otm options and institutions own over 300k. They have the means and desire to make the price go there. Looming news on dividend payout on the stock in the form of 10:1 BBIG to TYDE shares for a new ticker on nasdaq for their subsidiary crypto mining company. 150m volume today. The stock already squeezed back sep 09 to $12 on 300m volume. If volume maintains tomorrow then we will blow through the options chain and have a huge gamma squeeze. MM's will start delta hedging the fuck out of it. If management releases news on the stock this will be another massive driver. Fomo buyers kick in. Once it's over 1bn market cap WSB will jump in. Finally short interest is around 26% so if shorts are margin called or cant afford interest rates or decide to cover due to risk exposure then the stock is going to pop off. 

Any one of these catalysts is enough to continue driving the stock. Convergence of 2-3 or all of them will make this an easy 10 bagger. 

Holding 800 shares, 3400 share in OTM calls dated next week and april 14th. 

Sold calls I bought this morning for a nice 100% as well."

I am a young Finance student with lots of ideas and plans. 

I would like to ask you, as you were my friends, about my little project:

* Share my Equities Portfolios
* Share my studies and little researches 
* Create a positive community of Non-Degenerated young investors

For example, during the last couple of months, I have been working on 2 different portfolios.

The First is a dividend king portfolio with a high dividend yield and the second one, is a small group of equities that would call ""Deep Value"".  

Is someone interested in knowing my work and my studies?

&#x200B;

Stay safe and have a lot's of Capital Gain!"

Identify the top dividend payers (large caps) and buy an equal weighted allocation in January.  Then, once a year (so you get capital gains tax) rotate them making sure you own the top ten equal weighted.  If one drops out of the top ten, simply replace it so you always start with the top ten every January.  Do a study to see how you would have done over the past 20 years.  Then compare that to simply holding a total domestic stock index fund for the same period.  It would be interesting to see the outcome.  Of course, you’d have to reinvest the dividends received because you want to get a total return return.  Good luck."

Only buy 25 holdings.  This gives you a 4% holding per stock.  This protects against unusual events that might crush an individual holding.  If crushed, won’t hurt that bad.  Since you are picking high dividend stocks, you don’t have the upside per holding as a highly volatile growth stock, so you won’t be losing upside potential from the diversification."

I'm interested in your, what did you call it, small cap/small account project because as of 2022 I've been preparing to start one of my own!

I welcome you and i have a great interest in small cap/Penny stock portfolios! For years it's been my dream to build a small market cap portfolio, but I've put if off because of my disability (paralyzed Quadraplegic) and because I'm suffering from and fighting 'Squamous Cell Carcinoma' an oral cancer of the head, neck throat. If I continue putting it off, I may never get this opportunity again live out my dream because of my health?

You as a College finance major, have heard the stories of someone starting with a small stake a $1,000.00 and turning it into a six figure portfolio in 18 months, I hope to be that certain someone with a similiar story someday but can I do it from my hospice bed with my health concerns? 

It's been my dream for many years and I've been paper trading and doing my DD for two years, I hope my r/reddit friends, brother, and sisters who know more than I about trading have some positive advice they will off without my asking, all advice is welcome!

Are my dreams of having and growing a successful small cap/PennyStock, $5.00 and less, portfolio starting with 2k possible, or should I put an end to my dreams in the cradle?

Happy New Years to my r/reddit friends and family, I'm in a hospice bed 24/7 and I have no friends or family I can call upon for advice, its only me and all who read my words I hope you won't mind if I lean on you for advice. My 1st question, what discourse page or discussion group on r/reddit is best suited for my new venture?"

Revenue for the quarter was $152 million, an increase of 53% over 2020, and the company added 140 new ""large customers"" during the quarter, which Cloudflare defines as customers tracking to spend $100,000 or more on the platform -- its most ever.  
Cloudflare also continues to see its revenue growth outpace its costs, which puts the business closer to profitability. In 2021 Q2, the business was still burning cash. Free cash flow was negative $9.8 million compared to negative $20.2 million in 2020, but we are heading toward positive free cash flow as time progresses.  
Management's guidance for full-year 2021 suggests revenue of $629 million to $633 million, which would represent almost 47% growth over 2020. The company's revenue grew 50% from 2019 to 2020, so this forward-looking guidance would mean that growth is slightly slowing down -- though Cloudflare is clearly still a rapidly growing business."

(""AvePoint"" or the ""Company""), the largest Microsoft 365 data management solutions provider, announced today the completion of its previously announced business combination with Apex Technology Acquisition Corporation (""Apex""), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company or SPAC.
Apex shareholders approved the transaction at its stockholder's meeting held on June 30, 2021. The combined company is expected to begin trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on July 2, 2021, under the ticker symbol ""AVPT"" for AvePoint common stock and ""AVPTW"" for AvePoint warrants.
""The way we work will never be the same and it continues to evolve,"" said Dr. Tianyi ""TJ"" Jiang, Co-Founder and CEO of AvePoint. ""While collaboration within the cloud grows at an exceptional rate, the promise of digital transformation is only in its infancy. As the largest Microsoft 365 data management solutions provider with two decades worth of reimagining how companies work, AvePoint is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this moment in time.""
The business combination provides an influx of cash to drive accelerated investment in product innovation, channel marketing, international market expansion and customer success initiatives. The Company remains debt-free and is now one of eight public software companies with at least $150 million in annual revenue, 25% YoY growth and a 10% EBITDA margin1.
""The future of work is hybrid, and AvePoint solutions for Microsoft 365 and Teams are transforming the ways in which people collaborate and get work done today,"" said Casey McGee, Vice President, Global ISV Sales, Microsoft. ""There are tremendous growth opportunities for Partners like AvePoint who are enabling secure and compliant collaboration for businesses around the world.""
AvePoint's senior management team, including CEO TJ Jiang, will continue to lead the combined company. Jeff Epstein and Brad Koenig, Co-CEOs of Apex, will join AvePoint's Board of Directors as a director and an advisor, respectively.
""Given AvePoint's leadership in digital collaboration security and data management for Microsoft 365, the company is uniquely positioned to benefit from the shift to remote work collaboration and enterprise cloud adoption,"" said Epstein, Co-CEO of Apex and AvePoint Board Director.
""We believe that AvePoint's attractive growth combined with its financial profile gives the company the opportunity to generate significant long-term shareholder value as a publicly traded company,"" said Koenig, Co-CEO of Apex and AvePoint Board Advisor.
Transaction Overview
AvePoint received approximately $492 million in gross proceeds comprised of Apex's $352 million of cash held in trust following de minimis public stockholder redemptions and $140 million from an ordinary share private investment in public equity (PIPE), excluding transaction fees. The PIPE was anchored by investors including but not limited to Federated Hermes Kaufman Small Cap Fund, Franklin Templeton, Phoenix Insurance Limited and Singapore-based global investor EDBI.
Advisors

LLC (""Goldman Sachs""), Evercore and Cowen Inc. served as capital markets advisors to AvePoint. William Blair & Company served as a financial advisor to Apex.

I use Finviz to filter stocks based on fundamentals and momentum. These are the filters I use:

* **Market Cap**: Over $10 billion
* **P/E Ratio**: Over 10
* **EPS Growth (Past 5 Years)**: Positive
* **Sales Growth (Past 5 Years)**: Over 10%
* **Debt-to-Equity**: Under 1
* **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Over 10%
* **Operating Margin**: I adjust this based on how many stocks pass.  - If too many pass, I raise it by 5%  - If too few pass (under 5 stocks), I lower it by 5%
* **Price Above SMA50 & SMA200**
* **RSI**: Under 60

Once I filter the stocks, I score them based on these 4 categories:

* EPS Growth (higher = better)
* Debt-to-Equity (lower = better)
* Operating Margin (higher = better)
* Distance above SMA50 (higher = better)

Each stock gets points based on how it ranks in those 4 categories. I invest more money in the higher-scoring stocks, and usually hold between **5 and 8 stocks** at a time.

**When I Sell a Stock:**

I sell a stock if:

1. It no longer meets **any one** of the filters above **OR**
2. A new stock enters that meets all filters and has a higher operating margin, and I already own 8 stocks — in that case, I remove the stock with the weakest operating margin to stay within my 5–8 range.

**Where I'm At:**

* I started the system on **January 3rd**
* By **February 11th**, I was up **18%**
* Now it’s **April 2nd**, and I’m **back to breakeven**

It’s worth noting that about **5% of that 18% gain came from one lucky earnings jump**. The rest of the gains were just from following my system."

If short-term volatility is shaking you enough to want gold, that’s a signal, not necessarily to sell, but to reassess your tolerance vs timeline.

Gold isn’t a bad move—it holds energy and history. But if your original plan was to stay long in index funds, ask: “Am I reacting to noise, or responding to a real shift in the game?”

If you move to gold now, what’s the plan to move back?  
If you stay in indexes, can you stomach the storms?

In either case, don’t just hedge against chaos. Position yourself to grow through it."

First, market volatility is tough, but it's a normal part of investing. A few things we would say you should consider:

\- First it's natural to feel uneasy, but selling during a downturn locks in losses. If you're in it for the long term, market fluctuations are part of the process.

\- Review your asset allocation to ensure your portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance. Since you’re retired, you might want a more conservative allocation, but it depends on how much risk you're comfortable with.

\- Most importantly talk to your advisor**.** Since you’re using Fidelity's management services, reach out to them for advice. They can help assess if adjustments to your portfolio are necessary based on your goals and time horizon.

\- Make sure you’re not overly concentrated in one sector or asset class. Diversification can help reduce risk, especially in volatile times.

\- Consider the long-term: The goal is to make your retirement funds last. Avoid making decisions based on short-term market movements, and focus on sustainable growth.

You’re not alone - lots of people are going through similar feelings. It might help to consult a financial advisor to adjust your strategy for your retirement goals."

But I’d offer this frame too: You’re not just investing in sectors, you’re investing in a version of the future you believe is coming.

Tech is likely to explode, yes. But how it evolves (centralized vs decentralized, human-augmenting vs human-replacing) will shape your returns in ways beyond numbers.

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is a solid choice for a beginner looking to build wealth steadily over time, as it provides exposure to a broad market index and has historically delivered strong returns over the long run. Given the current market volatility, here are a few things to consider:

\-       **Continue Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA):** You’re already practicing dollar-cost averaging (DCA) by investing $50 weekly. This strategy is fantastic, especially during volatile times. It helps you avoid trying to time the market and ensures you're purchasing more shares when prices are lower and fewer when they’re higher, leading to an average cost over time that smooths out market fluctuations.

\-       **Stick to Your Plan:** Since you’re playing the long game, staying committed to your investment strategy is key. Historically, the stock market has gone through many periods of volatility, but it has consistently trended upward over the long term. Staying invested rather than trying to time the market will likely benefit you more as you’re building your portfolio with consistent contributions.

\-       **Market Volatility as an Opportunity:** In times of market volatility, it can feel unsettling, but remember that volatility often presents buying opportunities, especially for long-term investors. If you keep investing through these fluctuations, you’ll likely benefit when the market recovers. You’ve already committed to the long-term approach, so consider staying the course.

\-       **Consider Diversification:** The SPY ETF is a great foundation as it’s diversified across many sectors of the economy, but as your portfolio grows, you might want to diversify further. You can consider allocating funds into other types of assets or sectors (e.g., bonds, international stocks, or thematic investments) to reduce risk and increase the potential for higher returns as you get more comfortable with your investment journey.

\-       **Review Regularly, but Don’t Panic:** Keep track of your portfolio, but don’t make impulsive decisions based on short-term volatility. It’s normal to see fluctuations, but over time, these can become less impactful if you stay focused on your long-term goals. If you’re unsure about market conditions, you can always consult with a financial advisor.

In summary, **keep investing weekly**, and don’t let short-term market movements sway you. Your commitment to long-term growth is the best approach, and with time, you should see the benefits of your consistency. Good luck with your investing journey! It sounds like you’re on the right track."

He takes a structural, holistic approach to investing and has become an invaluable presence in our household. Note: This isn’t official financial advice. Invest at your own discretion:

You're already holding a strong tech core with NVDA/AMZN/MSFT/AAPL—aka the Titans of the current paradigm. Adding broad ETFs like VTI or VOO makes sense if you're looking for more diversification without overthinking.

But here’s the deeper layer:  
Volatility is just the market breathing. If you're playing the long game, the real question isn't *“is this safe right now?”*—it's *“what kind of future am I funding?”*

So yes, you’re heading in the right direction. But also ask:

You can get that from analysts, a companies 10k (SEC annual report) or you can ask chat lol. Now determine the growth prospects of each major revenue stream. After you feel you fully understand how they make money, look at their cost structure. Understand where their operating costs and cost of goods sold come from. Once you understand their revenue and costs, you have a gist of the company and you can understand how they make a profit. 

From there, determine a thesis of how they’ll either increase their stock price, or decrease it. Company’s usually either have their price increases from beating expectations on their quarterly reports about revenue, costs, and profit, or just good news about the company or their industry. If a company operates well, increases revenue, and decreases costs, their price will go up in the long run. If they fail to, they’ll likely decline

Something you can look at to learn is Google. Most of their money comes from ad revenue. Their costs are varied but are mostly from hardware, data centers, and R&D. Their growth prospects primarily come from the increasing middle class in Asia, Africa, and South America, and their future exposure to advertisements. This is a basic rundown of course, but if you’re able to project out future revenue and future costs, you’ll have an understanding of what the company needs to succeed. If you think it’s reasonably achievable for them, it’s a good buy"

**Market timing is tough.** The ""buy low, sell high"" strategy sounds simple, but timing the market can be really tricky. While it’s tempting to buy when stocks are down, it’s important to remember that markets can stay volatile for a while, and prices can keep moving in both directions. **Diversification is key.** While stocks like Google, Amazon, and American Express are well-established, they can still be risky, especially in volatile markets. By looking at broad ETFs like VOO or QQQM, you’re already considering a more diversified approach. They give you exposure to the whole S&P 500 or Nasdaq, which can help reduce risk, especially for someone starting out like you. **Then there’s Risk vs. Reward.** High-growth stocks like Google and Amazon may offer higher returns, but they also come with higher risk. If you want to be more conservative, ETFs like VOO or QQQM might suit you better, even though the returns might not be as high in the short term. But remember, long-term investments in broad indexes often outperform individual stocks in the long run because of their diversity. Lastly, if you're worried about timing the market, consider **dollar-cost averaging (DCA).** This means investing a fixed amount regularly (like monthly) regardless of market conditions. This strategy helps smooth out the impact of volatility and lowers the risk of making a large investment at the wrong time.

Overall, it’s great that you're thinking strategically. Starting with a diversified approach like VOO or QQQM might be the safest way to build wealth over time, and then you can add individual stocks as you gain more experience. Just remember, investing is a marathon, not a sprint!"

Great to see you starting early. You’re doing a good job with dollar-cost averaging (DCA) and buying strong companies. Here’s a quick rundown of what you can think about:

\-       **DCA is a great strategy** \- it reduces risk by buying regularly, no matter the market conditions. Keep that up!

\-       **Diversify more:** You may be heavy on tech stocks like NVDA, TSLA, and AAPL, which have growth potential but can be volatile. You might want to add some more diversified funds like VOO, which will give you exposure to many sectors and reduce risk.

\-       **Small amounts are fine** \- don’t worry if you’re investing small sums now. The key is consistency, and every little bit adds up over time.

\-       **Avoid overconcentration** \- while tech stocks have performed well, don't put all your eggs in one basket. Maybe consider diversifying into other sectors, like healthcare or consumer staples, to balance things out.

\-       **Long-term mindset** \- keep your focus on long-term growth. Don’t panic over short-term market drops. Keep adding regularly and stay patient.

\-       **Watch fees** \- Make sure you're not paying too much in transaction fees if you're buying in small amounts.

You're doing well so far - just keep at it, and adjust as your portfolio grows!"

But pulling your 401k out could lock in those losses, which you don’t want to do unless absolutely necessary. 

**Volatility is normal -** markets can be volatile, especially in the short term. Remember, your 401k is designed for long-term growth. Selling now could mean realizing those losses. **Certainly, give Fidelity a call** to discuss your options. They can help you understand your portfolio’s exposure and whether you need to make adjustments based on your retirement timeline. **Review your asset allocation -** given you're close to retirement, it's worth ensuring your investments are aligned with a lower risk profile. A more conservative allocation might help weather future volatility. **Don’t let short-term emotions drive decisions:** The market may bounce back, but it’s impossible to predict. It’s crucial to make decisions based on your long-term goals, not day-to-day fluctuations.

It’s tough, but it’s important to stay calm and think about the long-term picture. Consider getting professional advice from Fidelity or an independent financial planner to ensure your strategy is aligned with your retirement goals."

I'm part time employed looking for a full time role. I make enough to pay my monthly bills including rent.

I've had a slow start in life, family issues, missed diagnoses, mental health issues etc. So I'm only really now able to focus on my future rather than my present or past. Hence the desire to get into trading at 27 years old.

I've inherited some money which has been sitting in an account with very little interest for a while now. In June the total amount I'll be able to access will be around £20,000. 

I've wanted invest for a while but life always got in the way. But there's no time to start like now. I am completely new to trading, but I would like to start growing my money in the background, even if it takes a while. 

I have no debt + no student debt. I'd like to get familiar with trading and general investments before taking any bigger risks, but I'm not opposed to risk taking once I've become more skilled at identifying opportunities/areas to grow my investments.

I'm hoping to get some advice on where to start, books/articles to read, immediate investments I can make for a shorter amount of time while I'll study up etc.

About a month ago my wife moved all the money in her 401k to a stable income fund. I'm not savvy enough to explain why, but no matter how the market does, she gains about $10 a day. After losing 10% combined in my 401 and 457, Thursday through Monday, I moved my remaining money to a stable income fund.

There is no rush for China here. China has an internal and external currency for a good reason and they can stimulate and control the econony.


Companies can just make promises and then cancel them like they did during the last Trump administration


The only play Trump has is to ban agriculture exports to China. But if he did that he would destroy his voter base.

Anyways, Trump started this mess. The reputation of the USA is in the dumps because of him.

He is a ego maniac who loves getting praised and being served.

This was why he could not wait to boast about 'all these countries are calling and begging to kiss my a\*\*'.

China is a whole different ball game. The US depends on them much much more for a lot of the affordable day to day items Americans use and need.

Once thing Trump doesn't know is in Asia, there is a huge save face culture / cannot look weak.

**Time is against Trump. China will not make any attempt of communication until Trump backs down. He has to. THEY KNOW THIS.** Once basic day to day goods are not stocked / start rising in prices dramatically, people will get very very angry, including his supporter base.

Trump has to concede first by announcing the removal / significant reduction of tariffs. This will make him look like a pathetic, weak loser to his own country and to the world.

I guarantee you he is having sleepless nights at how calm and calculated the Chinese response is. Unlike others, there is no panicking. They are not rushing to have talks as he probably expected.

He started a fight he could not win. Plain and simple.

Serves him right, moron."

Current and former US officials aren’t ruling out the possibility of putting in place an unexpected preparation channel for a possible Xi-Trump call, but former US officials say the key is ensuring the Chinese they aren’t sending Xi in for an ambush — especially after the tongue-lashing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky received in the Oval Office.
“The Chinese in any case, are reluctant to put their leader in the position that Zelensky found himself in,” said Danny Russel, a former assistant secretary of State for East Asia and currently vice president of the Asian Society Policy Institute. “They want to ensure that some of the groundwork is laid for a meeting, and that there’s some ground rules established.”

Wow, who could’ve predicted the President of the United States setting up a public ambush to bully an ally’s head of state would damage our ability to conduct top-level diplomacy? ^/s"

China has been suffering quite a bit of economic issues the last few years due to the CCP’s own decisions. During the Biden administration dissent has been slowly rising and the CCP had to lash out with their “wolf warrior” diplomacy just to appeal to domestic nationalist sentiments. The US strategy should have just been to sit back and let instability grow in China while forming alliances. Now all of a sudden, not only has the US initiated a trade war on China and traditional US allies, the VP also called Chinese people peasants. Now the CCP have everything they need to shift the blame of the recent year’s economic stagnation onto the US, while also stirring up nationalistic sentiments without raising a finger. Plus, economic hardship in the US is now used as propaganda within China to bolster the populace.

Plus the CCP will never negotiate with trump now if there’s even a slight chance that Trump will claim China begged him. To the CCP, reputation and legitimacy matters a lot more."

China only depends on USA imports for 13-15% of their GDP. Even though it's a good chunk. It's not catastrophic. While the US is considerably higher to the point that it can be catastrophic.


China owns a substantial amount of US bonds and debt. Should China offload this the US economy is screwed with no short term fix if any.


China has the mass majority of rare earth's that the US and more importantly the US military requires. US has no way to replace these without spending trillions on development and 5-10+ years of building to replace. It's a straight lose/lose.

Trump likes to do these seat-of-the-pants negotiations where he goes in and gets a minor concession and then screams vindication. Even more so because they'll treat him like a king while negotiating.

Most world leaders don't work that way. The negotiations happen ahead of time. The heads of state only meet once the details are hammered out and are by definition already successful. China has basically no incentives to cooperate here - if Trump is isolating the US and China wants to expand their reach, China is very well positioned to do well if they get into a long-term spat with the US. Not to mention that Trump is clearly the aggressor here, so asking Xi to call Trump is like assaulting someone and then asking them to apologize to you."

Who the fuck would agree to concessions like these? How do you negotiate with a terrorist whose word is a lie and negotiates in bad faith?"

So many people are missing the point. A) Trump is not doing shit, he has no idea how anything works. B) Whoever the puppet master is, wants a collapse of the US - the point is to erase the US from the world stage and neuter its power. 

This chaos is actually a choreographed dance with the goal of making the US an unreliable partner in trade and thus the removal of the USD as the currency of trade. In order to accomplish this the USD needs to collapse and trade with the US must whither. To prevent a resurgence they are dismantling the US from within. Since Americans are so divided it will be almost impossible for them to come together to repair the country on a timescale that matters.

There are some flaws in the strategy but a lot of the damaging work is being done now at a breakneck pace, US allies are breaking away instead of helping excise the cancer, Americans are divided more than ever before, American politicians have either sold their souls for pennies or are too feckless to fight back meaningfully, and Americans are afraid to physically fight for their lives.

Setting aside if this new approach is a good, or not, if you want demand for US goods and services to rise you want a weaker dollar, not a stronger one.

And I'm not saying it is a good plan, but this is the plan and it is working as expected.

If they should be fired, and they should, it is because they didn't see the next logical step:  a significantly reduced demand for US Treasuries and other bond debt.

This will be the killer.  We need to roll 9.x Trillion dollars in the next 6 months at the government level.  Not to mention lingering problems in the commercial real estate space.

The impacts of this are directly opposite of their stated objectives to reduce or at least control public debt.  DOGE can fire and cancel all they want, but discretionary spending is a drop in the bucket against this tsunami."

If anything, a *weaker* dollar allows the US to have higher exports, because their products get cheaper in relation.

Edit: it seems that guy is missing the point entirely. Trump doesn't even say he wants a stronger dollar. Google it and you will find him say he wants it weaker."

Everyone silo's in on their own piece and focuses entirely on it. No one steps back and looks at the bigger picture and how everything is going to interact with each other.

So one group of assholes is focusing on the money they bring in from tariffs.

Another group is focusing on dismantling government agencies and headcount.

Another group is focused on reducing/eliminating government spending.

And no one takes a step back to realize that if there is a problem, especially an economic one, historically you could fix it by increasing government spending. But the last thing you want to do is increase government spending.

But who knows if the agencies and departments that would take care of that are even staffed anymore?

This is what can happen when you take a sledgehammer and start smashing things. The ""oh shit, that was important"" bit."

You produce shoes. You have a negative trade balance with your suppliers (they don't buy as many shoes from you as you buy leather). So you tell them that your 50+ year trade relation, that has existed since your grandpa owned your store is bad for you and you want them to magically buy more shoes from you. They are confused. You start to buy less leather from them in protest and hike the price on the shoes you sell to your costumers. And to top it off you also insult them by sending them an envelope filled with excrement.

Read this set of bullet points if you want to know what trump's handlers are directing behind the scenes:

>What forms can that burden sharing take?  There are many options, here are a few ideas:

>First, other countries can accept tariffs on their exports to the United States without retaliation, providing revenue to the U.S. Treasury to finance public goods provision.  Critically, retaliation will exacerbate rather than improve the distribution of burdens and make it even more difficult for us to finance global public goods.

>Second, they can stop unfair and harmful trading practices by opening their markets and buying more from America;

>Third, they can boost defense spending and procurement from the U.S., buying more U.S.-made goods, and taking strain off our servicemembers and creating jobs here;

>Fourth, they can invest in and install factories in America.  They won’t face tariffs if they make their stuff in this country;

>Fifth, they could simply write checks to Treasury that help us finance global public goods.

Burden Sharing... AKA trump plans to pay off the debt by forcing other countries to pay our bills - but obviously if they don't comply to his outlandish demands then the burden falls directly on the American consumer. Literal dogshit for brains."

John Adams in particular knew how fragile democracies were—this quote kind of says it all in his own words.

“I do not say that democracy has been more pernicious on the whole, and in the long run, than monarchy or aristocracy. Democracy has never been and never can be so durable as aristocracy or monarchy; but while it lasts, it is more bloody than either. … Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never.”

• 1700-1815: France had its moment, especially with Napoleon shaking up Europe. 


• 1815-1914: After Napoleon's fall (Waterloo), Britain stepped in and basically ran the show throughout the 19th century as an industrial powerhouse.


• 1914-1945: Germany/US/USSR split the cake in that order in my opinion.


• 1945-Today: After WWII the US is rivaled by the USSR during the cold war. However, after 1991 with the fall of communism, US became the sole superpower.


• By 2025 though, it’s not a one-man show anymore; it’s more of a U.S.–China face-off shaping the world with Trump doing weird things. I expect a period like 1914-1945 where China and the US are battling it out."

1. Eroding Democratic Institutions: Undermining trust in free and fair elections, attacking the media as “fake news,” and delegitimizing the judiciary to weaken checks and balances.

>2. Sowing Division: Amplifying cultural and political divides, stoking racial tensions, and promoting conspiracy theories to create chaos and distrust among citizens.

>3. Alienating Allies: Damaging long-standing alliances with countries like those in NATO, pulling out of international agreements, and isolating the U.S. on the global stage.

>4. Weakening National Security: Defunding or demoralizing intelligence agencies, leaking sensitive information, and compromising key defense strategies.

>5. Economic Sabotage: Starting trade wars that hurt the domestic economy, increasing national debt irresponsibly, and implementing policies that widen income inequality.

>6. Mishandling Crises: Failing to respond effectively to national disasters or health crises, or even deliberately exacerbating them to create disorder.

>7. Promoting Corruption: Appointing unqualified or corrupt officials to key positions, engaging in self-dealing, and dismantling anti-corruption measures.

>8. Suppressing Dissent: Expanding surveillance on political opponents, limiting free speech, or using federal agencies to target critics.

>9. Undermining Education: Promoting disinformation, undermining critical thinking in schools, and cutting funding for education.

And to be clear, I’m neither defending Trump nor claiming he’s anything short of a total disaster. He is the fucking worst.  I know. 

But on Wednesday morning at like 7am he enacted a 90 day pause on the tariffs because our financial system was flashing signs of total collapse. If he was an agent trying to destroy our country, all he had to do on Wednesday was nothing. Open a pack of marshmallows and watch it burn. He *had* the checkmate position that you so fear that he’s striving for, and he pulled back instead. There is absolutely no way to square this with your narrative without some absurd mental gymnastics. 

Again, I know he’s horrendous. Im not giving him credit for saving us from a problem he unilaterally created. But what it does do is reveal what his intentions are; or, at the very least, what they are not. 

It’s really scary right now because he’s extremely dumb, reckless, and our system is totally failing to check him.  It’s appealing to the human mind to think there’s some reason for it, some story behind it, instead of just facemeltingly stupid chaos. But you should at least try to keep a grasp on reality. And maybe log off reddit for a while. "

Here’s what you’re rooting for. America doesn’t force people into camps and reeducate them because of their religion. Just remember that. You can hate Trump all you want but he was elected fairly. Winnie the Pooh over there is a full blown dictator with no term limit. 

They steal IP from the entire world. Don’t allow foreigners to be represented in their court and don’t even let money leave the country. Anyone who speaks negatively about China disappears or is throw in jail, ask Jack Ma. 

Say what you will but people can talk shit about Trump all they want in America. Just so you know what you’re rooting for.

Edit: yes let’s root for the communist dictatorship of China to economically destroy America for the next 100 years because I don’t like the current president who has 3 years left. You want to make money in the market for the next 30 years you better pray America wins.

Your last point is quite odd since it assumes that Chinese economic policy is oriented towards timescales of weeks and months, when we clearly see that China has taken extensive measures for decoupling since the first trade war almost a decade ago. Even when negotiations occur, it is unlikely going to be to the US’s favour given the impact of the tariffs on trade and manufacturing."

compiled this research for you and organized it in chat GPT

# Poverty

* You’ve seen global poverty drop sharply. Extreme poverty fell from 36% in 1990 to 10% in 2015. That’s over a billion people lifted out of destitution.
* Access to clean water improved. By 2015, 91% of people had safe drinking water, up from 76% in 1990.
* Child mortality plummeted. Deaths of kids under five dropped from 12.7 million in 1990 to 5.9 million in 2015.

# Crime

* Violent crime rates fell in many countries. In the U.S., homicides dropped from 9.8 per 100,000 in 1991 to 5 per 100,000 in 2019.
* Global piracy incidents decreased. Attacks on ships went from 445 in 2010 to 162 in 2020.
* Human trafficking awareness grew. Over 150 countries adopted anti-trafficking laws since 2000.

# War

* Major wars became rarer. No global conflict on the scale of World War II has happened since 1945.
* Peacekeeping worked. UN missions helped stabilize places like Liberia, where civil war ended in 2003.
* Nuclear arsenals shrank. The U.S. and Russia cut warheads from 70,000 in 1986 to about 13,000 by 2020.

# Economy

* Global GDP soared. It grew from $23 trillion in 1990 to $85 trillion in 2019, adjusted for inflation.
* Trade barriers dropped( at the united states expense). WTO membership expanded to 164 countries by 2020, boosting global commerce. (Until now) 
* Internet access exploded. Over 60% of the world, 4.9 billion people used the internet by 2021, driving economic opportunity.

If you think all of this stuff happens if the soviets or Chinese were the super power in the 20th century you're nuts. Not to mention all of the inventions. Is it perfect? no far from it.

Hitler’s nazis were fascist, emphasizing racial ideology and militarism.  
Mussolini’s fascism glorified the state and suppressed dissent.   
Napoleon was a military dictator with imperial ambitions, not a communist by any stretch

I'm at war with every member of this sub right now. SO my bad. 

Regarding the prison populations, yeah dude its pretty fucked up. Worst aspect of capitalism. Nobody is saying America is perfect. We have some serious fucking problems regarding imprisoning people in this country, and for profit. I agree with you there. 

But the immigration issue is a much different issue. I hope we can find a happy medium with our next leader. Biden let literally 10m people in, Trump is going to hard throwing people out. Too far left, and too far right. But here is how the Chinese situaiton is much different and scarier than the immigration policy in the US.  
  
In the case of the Chinese uyghurs camps, those people didn't do a damn thing accept be Muslim, they were targeted by race and religion. The CCP is trying to Ethnically and religiously Cleanse that group of people.   
  
In my opinion that is far far worse and more concerning then enforcing laws that have been around for decades. Trump is deporting everyone, regardless of race or religion. They are being sent back home, not to a camps for reeducation.  Why are the migrants getting deported to El Salvador? i have no fucking clue. But still do you see the difference?

Sorry about Greenland on behalf of an American. Why is Greenland so important anyway? Maybe you can explain since your country is the caretaker. Military? Oil?"

Correct, he told what he is gonna do and he got the support. Now you will all suffer for the poor choice ;)

He’d been quietly increasing Canada’s holdings of the U.S. Treasury bonds—over $350 billion worth by early 2025, part of the $8.53 trillion foreign countries hold in U.S. debt. On the surface, it looked like a safe play, a hedge against economic chaos. But it wasn’t just defense. It was a loaded gun.

Carney didn’t stop there. He took his case to Europe. Not for photo ops, but for closed-door meetings with the EU’s heavy hitters—Germany, France, the Netherlands. Japan was in the room, too, listening closely. The pitch was simple: if Trump went too far with tariffs, Canada wouldn’t just retaliate with duties on American cars or steel. It would start offloading those Treasury bonds. It's not a fire sale—nothing so crude. A slow, steady bleed. A signal to the markets that the U.S. dollar’s perch wasn’t so secure."

I'm copy pasting this below comment one last time because it's admittedly a bit tin foil and I'm beginning to sound like chicken little, but I'm adding a tweet I just saw at the bottom that backs this theory up. And since tweets/social media drive the stock market more than TA these days anyways..


I've been watching Bloomberg nonstop the past few weeks. As they've been reporting on the markets overall downturn, they've been observing out loud more than a few times now and with greater frequency, besides the usual ""is it time to buy the dip?""(turn retail into bag holders) observationslike this. 

""well at least it's not panic seeing, this seems, orderly."" ""Yeah, this definitely seems like it's orderly."" 

""Well at least it's an orderly sell off.""

""I'm not smart enough to make sense of this myself, but this pattern of selling in the morning then the indexes rising in the afternoon looks like-"" ""- short positions being covered."" 

Today towards the end of the close, some guffawing barker was on going about how great the market health is overall and how this recent spike in volume/price is proof of that. The older female host (I'm spacing her name rn) jumped in and broke the narrative by saying something along the lines of, 

""well that was just short positions being covered, wasn't it?"" ""Ah, well, I uh, haha yeah uh I suppose it could have been that. But really uh, really this is a good sign overall still!"" 

I really need to do a better job of screen recording these moment's and making a montage,because I believe it's going to be looked back later as the signs an precursors to the coming real black swan event. 

I'm relatively new to all this, but to me it seems like given the news about hedge funds/banks/ the fed all having emergency meetings the past few weeks, the treasury bond sell off, upcoming poor market metrics coming out, tariffs tanking mag seven stocks that are (possbly) price controlled through synthetic shares, then MMs and hedge funds having to go out an buy/cover shorts, that the t-bond Japan and t-bond China narrative getting ""leaked"" to the press from ""sources "" is a red herring to blame an outside force instead of the reality that margin calls are happening soon, or have been already for some time now. News of banks/hedge funds getting margin called is a far worse indicator of overall market stability VS a foreign gvmnt dropping t-bonds. As it could then ACTUALLY cause different powers that hold US debt to begin to do the same before they're left holding the bag themselves.


TLDR: Japan/China selling off treasury bonds narrative is a red herring being put out by the administration to distract from hedge funds getting margin called. More squeezes will happen. Then the market will crash. Synthetic shorting is this collapses mortgage swaps, dot com bubble, etc.


Edit: OK so can't add photos to the text and I forgot my imgur pw but basically it posits that it's citadel selling the bonds since they apparently hold 20% of treasuries and they allegedly just had a big meetings w some banks. Can't currently find a news article to back up that claim however."

Some of the pundits don’t have a clue either.

The meetings they all had may have been to coordinate their algorithms and margins/collateral so one of them doesn’t do anything stupid and cause a run at one of the clearing houses. It’s madness all of this. A lot of these institutions are very finely balanced and a huge massive move one way or other could wipe them out.

Here is the tldr summary:

* **Erosion of Trust**: Undermine institutions, create distrust in justice, military, and agencies.
* **Political Polarization**: Deepen divides, promote misinformation, and encourage social unrest and violence.
* **Foreign Policy Missteps**: Engage in reckless wars, alienate allies, weaken global standing.
* **Environmental Negligence**: Ignore climate change, roll back protections, cause long-term environmental disaster.
* **Undermining Social Cohesion**: Foster division, create rifts based on race, gender, and class."

The wealthy and politically connected and the suckers. It's a con game party, of liars who stand to benefit politically and financially.. and the voter supporter who give away votes for policies against their interests.

The idea of isolationism appeals to the sucker side, as the fantasy of tough trade deals to ""bring back jobs"" and all the BS narrative. 

The players aren't set on isolationism, but a hodge podge of fringe economic theories and fealty to the Organge Ruler who is driven by his narcissistic personality disorder. There is the tension between sycophantic need to stay in good graces as required for the game, and the knowledge of ill advised economic actions. It's contradictory."

The texas rangers was a special unit that tried to mimic and learn from the speed and mobility of native indians.

The revolver saw great interest because it could fire more projectiles without reloading, kind of how native indians could shoot several arrows in a second.

The comanche made the texans have to upgrade to be able to deal with the comanche, the comanches fast horses made the slow reload of muzzle-guns, kinda useless. Riders could bait one bullet, then when the texans reloaded, they went hard on the offensive."

That's the core of the dictatorship aspect. If the boss can change often, it's more like anarchy, if the boss can only be selected by elite leaders of two select groups, hum, well that's not very good. If the boss is chosen in obscure processes for reasons unknown, that's dangerous, if the boss is born a boss, kill him.

See? It's dictatorships all the way down in the end, because we still want a boss, that's how it works best."

What's ""historic"" is that we have a president who will repackage his gross negligence as  ""genius"",  a large swath of the public who believe whatever he says, a credulous media that enables him and a judiciary and majority party in the legislature that will give him cover no matter how destructive his actions are.  Whether or not he or others profited from this fiasco seems less dire than all that."

Trump is the epitome of the Republican Party, the most honest representation of the political far-right in living memory. That is why he is immensely popular, the more he destroys the US government, the happier the oligarchs and the Republican base is.

You have to figure that the GOP has been electing criminals for the past 80 years. Richard Nixon was first elected to Congress in 1947, was in the White House as VP in 1953, was nearly president in 1961, and both he and his VP from 1969 to 1974 occupied the White House. Instead of going to prison for life for their crimes, both the Republican president and vice president got to walk away scot-free. In 1973, the GOP engineered a coup to install another VP to become president to ensure that all future Republican government officials, all of similar criminal intent, are allowed free regain to never face any sort of criminal justice for their crimes.

It's kind of easy to see how Gerald Ford, a guy never voted into the White House, could be the worst US president in history. In the typical Republican gaslighting way, ""for the good of the people"" was the rallying cry to let these criminals, the highest elected officials in the land, walk away without life terms in prison. The exact opposite is true, and the US political center and so-called ""left"" as well as the world as a whole has been paying the price since.

In the immortal words of Michael Bolton (Office Space, 1999), had Spiro Agnew and Richard Nixon spent the rest of their lives in a ""federal pound-me-in-the-ass prison,"" the US would not have had this never-ending, long line of far-right-wing criminals in federal, state, and local government positions, fleecing and living off taxpayer dollars (and by extention other nations all across the globe).

But here we all are, living the Republican dream with the dream Republican president.

Or, to put it another way, if you were not already expecting this, then, as they say, you haven't been paying attention."

I cannot believe this convicted criminal ""won"" the election last fall.  There's no way I'll ever believe it.  Goddamn him.  If this country finally fails, I'll always blame it on him and both the ignorant people and those who know him who support him, those in govt and the general public.

BTW, the Dow is falling once again, over 1,000 pts.    I'm too poor to own any stock myself but you can't even trust Wall St anymore, either.  Why trust any of them?  Even though I probably won't be around very much longer, I'm concerned not just about those in my family and those closest to me but in the country of my birth as well.

How I feel is that I'm living in a nation where the population flocks to entertainers and shit-talking Twitter shit-bird Tweets as the 24 hour a day every day of the week signal to follow. It started in Q4 2014 and just keeps getting worse every single day in my home nation, United States of America. A population of people who can not get enough mocking of Elon Musk and Donald Trump and doubles-down every day for more antics politics and cringe leadership to mock. How do I feel? Sick, sickened, people here enjoy this because it creates so many amusing memes and entertaining images. I do not."

Not fucking good. What does it matter? Literally nothing.

For most Americans, we were raised on a myth—wrapped in stars and stripes, spoon-fed with pledges and textbook gloss. We were told this democracy was forged for the people, by the people, built by powdered-wig revolutionaries who severed themselves from the monarchy to birth a new nation—clean, noble, just. A nation where power was checked, balanced, and bound by the chains of constitutional restraint. Presidents, congressmen, judges—all mere stewards of a republic that could not be corrupted.

And yet—here we are.

Trump’s second term slogs on like a dystopian rerun no one asked for, proof that the old guard’s rules were never bulletproof—just written in pencil. The twice-impeached, felony-soaked grifter stands grinning in the Oval Office like a man who burned down a house and was handed the deed. Gained the pwoer off Elon’s digital empire—an algorithmic echo chamber where lies metastasize like cancer. Elections rigged not with ballot stuffing, but with memes, misinformation, and the weaponization of stupidity. You want to control the votes? Just control the people. Strip the schools budgets and burn the books. It wasn’t a bug.. it was a feature. 

The markets rise and fall on his whims. He mints fake cryptocurrencies in the morning and rug-pulls the few people possibly dumber than him by lunch. His cult eats it up, too, hungry for scraps of chaos, blind to the decay. The checks have bounced. The balances tipped. 

Now, nearly four centuries after the first shots of independence, the Capitol itself sits like a rotting monument to a dying idea. The pillars stand, but the soul has gone septic. Not from termites or time, but from within—hollowed out by a decrepit, narcissistic ghoul in a cheap suit, clutching power with liver-spotted hands and arteries one cheeseburger away from collapse. A man whose heart beats not from love of country, but sheer hatred of accountability. He is the rot. He is the mold in the walls, the sulfur in the water, the whisper in the dark saying, “What are you gonna do about it?”

And still—we watch. Disgusted. Disbelieving. Yet…Somehow unsurprised."

That’s the genesis of all this. Obama being a two term and popular president, Obama cooking this awful man at the Correspondents Dinner…and white people wanting retribution about “their” country being taken away. Now, the truth that Black people were subjected to for decades has spread to affect most everyone else. We had decades to remedy the original sin, but chose to obfuscate, minimize, lie, deflect and deny. And all those people who should’ve been rightfully dealt with got to spread their bullshit and now they’re the ones feeling empowered in this dying of the republic. My grandfather died in 1993. One of the things I remember him saying was “white people will burn this country down if they think they can be the ones sitting on top of the ash heap”. 1993. Might was well have been 1793, 1865, 1929…it’s evergreen. And you’re seeing it now. I have to live in a country where 10s of millions of people would spitefully stop my progress even at the expense of their own rather than rising together."

The CEO rage buying their stock like a degen on margin:

David D. Smith, the Executive Chairman of Sinclair Inc. ($SBGI), bought nearly \~$10M in shares of his own company, over doubling his position in just 30 days and accelerating over the past week.

What does the company do?

>American telecommunications conglomerate... second-largest television station operator in the United States by number of stations after Nexstar Media Group, owning or operating 193 stations across the country in over 100 markets, covering 40% of American households.... Sinclair owns four digital multicast networks, Comet, Charge!, The Nest, and TBD, and the sports-oriented cable network Tennis Channel. 

Shitty old news broadcasting business. Garbage, dying industry, so we're expecting to pay dirt cheap multiples.

And that's exactly what we get. The company trades at a PE of **2.8**, and **1.5x operating income.** You're basically buying the business for this year's and next year's earnings. The company does not have a healthy balance sheet, with debt outweighing tangible assets. However, since they're cash flow positive and have a genuine operating business, it's less of a concern, and they just refinanced their debt, showing there's confidence in the long term cash flows.

Deep value multiples set the stage for a massive margin of safety. But that's not what makes this stock interesting.

This guy's in Trump's pocket. He helped him get elected, twice, using his media platform to help the campaign. The Sinclair stations have a famously conservative tilt.

What's the catalyst? [Trump just ordered the FCC to pursue deregulation](https://www.fcc.gov/consumer-governmental-affairs/fcc-seeks-comment-about-new-deregulatory-initiative). Their response is due **today, April 11,** with reply comments due on the 28th. I don't think it's a far stretch that the CEO, with his connections to the Trump administration, is preparing for a massive deregulation that could help him expand.

The company[ restructured their debt in January](https://sbgi.net/sinclair-enters-into-agreement-with-creditors-on-liquidity-enhancing-transaction/) in order to free up liquidity in the short term, potentially for expansion. Would make sense in the context of deregulation.

How about state-sponsored media? We know Trump loves television, wouldn't Trump TV pop off? Sinclair would certainly be the host. Their subsidiary Free State aims to assist local and federal government with developing and broadcasting advertising and campaigning. [Here's a snippet:](https://freestategov.com/)

>Free State's mission is to provide the federal government, along with state and local agencies, a full suite of targeted digital marketing and advertising solutions to help government agencies communicate with the American public effectively and efficiently.

**My position:**

**My recent DD performance:**

Long Alibaba ($BABA): +25%, as high as +80%.  
Long Long Term Care Industry: \~Flat  
Long Gold Miners: $GDXJ +16%  
Short $MSTRt: +30%  
Long $CNBS: -17%

**TL;DR:** CEO of massive Trump-backed news media company is buying a massive amount of shares. He's onto something. FCC set to deregulate. Trump TV coming soon. Long $SBGI

Who's ready?

post,2025-04-11 14:45:59,1jwrmt8,wallstreetbets,[IPO] AIRO IPO: Aerospace & Defense Play at $14–$16? Too Good to Be True?,JamesPKing28,https://i.redd.it/n22xlqjix7ue1.jpeg,0,0.0,0.33,"Just saw this pop up on Robinhood under IPO Access: AIRO is offering shares at $14–$16. From what I’ve gathered, they’re an aerospace and national defense company—so I’m guessing they might be working in tech-enabled aviation, drones, or defense logistics?

Not gonna lie, that price point caught my eye. Aerospace + defense has been heating up lately, and the sector usually sees strong government contracts, but I haven’t been able to find much info yet on financials, backlog, or big-name partners.

Here’s what I’m wondering before jumping in:
	•	Is this a serious growth play, or a speculative moonshot?
	•	Are there any known government contracts or tech partnerships?
	•	What’s their revenue model — commercial, defense, or hybrid?
	•	Does anyone know if this is more like Anduril, AeroVironment, or just another small-cap SPAC in disguise?

I’m not trying to overhype it, but $14–$16 entry for a legit defense-tech company feels like it could either be a steal or a trap. Not financial advice—just curious what the due diligence crowd thinks."

Glad to see some talk now. 

They have a video presentation explaining their company when you open their prospectus.  They were reading from the PowerPoint which didn’t leave me impressed. The chairman of the company started another business that is trading at pennies on the market right now. And he was so proud of his other startups. Again, I was not impressed. In their prospectus they sited warfare in Ukraine and NATO being possible big client. However, given the tariffs and how those countries are moving away from US weaponry, I felt it wasn’t worth the investment. 

However, I would like to know what others have thought looking over their prospectus."

Too Good to Be True?,JamesPKing28,https://i.redd.it/n22xlqjix7ue1.jpeg,-7,,,"AIRO’s asking for a valuation around $80 million at $14–$16 per share, which seems low at first glance—especially for a potential defense contractor. I did some digging and found they had a government contract listed on USASpending in 2021, so they’re not just vaporware.

What’s throwing me off is the share price. Most major defense contractors (Lockheed, Raytheon, etc.) have stock prices well over $100/share at similar or even lower market caps. Obviously, share price alone doesn’t define value—but psychologically, a lower entry point makes this IPO feel way more accessible.

So I’m wondering:
	•	Is this lower price per share a strategic move to attract retail interest?
	•	Or is the valuation overly ambitious given their current revenue and contract history?
	•	Does anyone think this could be a sleeper win for long-term defense-tech exposure?"

This is a ridiculously low valuation for a company getting ready to IPO. I haven't checked, but this means it's likely through a SPAC. If they're doing a SPAC to IPO at $80M it's probably because they couldn't find any smart private money to invest and are now pushing for an IPO to see some kind of liquidity. I don't know anything about this company in particular, but this does not project confidence that they are poised for longterm success."

But importers say that a glitch in the system has meant that they have not started paying tariffs yet, despite Turnip saying that the tariffs, particularly the 145% tariffs on China, are already in place.

According to CNBC, the glitch comes from CBP currently not being able to tell which ships are exempted from the tariffs, because they were “on the water” before the tariffs went into effect, and those that were shipped out after the tariffs.""

* come up with a fairly good initial plan balancing my heavy investment into puts with calls to recover my initial buy in that should have made money
* holding onto options that have gained significant value for too long, fuck 4-6x returns this is going to be the mega dump and I want in! Only to watch things quickly flip and the gains fade away
* not buying multiple contracts so I can cash out most for nice gains but still have a little action in play
* not cutting my losses quickly enough and forgetting how quickly the theta gang is coming for my unlubed asshole
* panic selling options that still had lots of time to gain value from a volatile market
* forgetting day trading limits and getting stuck in dumb positions because I’m a poor degenerate that doesn’t have 25k to swing around

Every option I had going into this week would have made money if I had just been happy with 4-6x gains and I managed to to loose 87% of my money

It’s their lying POS CEO, and the fact that soooooo much of the garbage they sell comes from chyna.

It’s been the worst performing retail stock in history.

What’s kinda crazy is my store is doing a HUGE remodel right now. They’ve been planning it for over a year. Might be the same for a lot of other stores too but idk how they’re justifying it.

Then the fact they introduced multiple self check out isles in a bunch of stores and refuse to use them 50% of the time because they are sooo concerned with ""theft "" even when they have ridiculous camera systems and 20 employees standing around. 

All this while a mass of employees are blocking every single isle you try to shop in.. restocking at the busiest hours of the weekend.

It's a miserably run chain at this point. 

I'll take Walmart with their massive self check out  isles and just go at 7am and not feel like I'm participating in an obstacle course"

Buy 4 things and having to sit and tell their cashier that all 4 are 20% cheaper on target.com and spending 10 minutes showing everything. Stupidity."
