Current Roth portfolio: 

BRK.B

O

UNH

I’d probably trim O and add more to CCI, as it’s been the better performer as of late. They both pay nice dividends. UNH I bought earlier last year and it did really well. I wish I sold after the CEO assassination but I don’t mind holding this one a little longer. I don’t think I want to add any new positions in my Roth.

GOOG (looking to aggressively add if it dips below 160)

META (might add a little)

MELI (might add a little)

VST (honestly not sure what to do here but holding atm)

LB (holding)

TMDX (holding)


Names/industries I’m looking to add:

RDDT (after the huge drop idk)

UBER

HOOD

TPL

Cyber security (looking at PANW/RBRK)

comment,mghlu2h,stocks,Rate My Portfolio - r/Stocks Quarterly Thread March 2025,dvdmovie1,,2,"In terms of Target, you've had an issue for a while now where WMT is really stealing market share as people trade down. Target is the middle and the middle is being eroded. Is the magnitude of the trade down sustainable? I don't know but I do think that the longer this trade down occurs and the more those people shop at WMT the more ingrained that becomes. How does Target compete against that? The primary thing is likely they have to compete on price, which is not great. Tariffs will be another issue. I would not be surprised if there is a new CEO sooner than later, but what can they really do?

So, I don't know. From my perspective, a problem I have with Target is that I look at the broader issues and I don't see it changing any time soon or easy answers to solve it.  That said, given what the stock has done and the situation as is at this point in time, how much of that is baked into the stock? It feels like the kind of thing where okay news could - at least temporarily - cause a nice rally. Any sort of improvement in the tariff situation could cause a rally. Of course, any material worsening of these situations (and if what's going on turns into more of a slowdown) could also cause further erosion.

""5k in SoFi""

I don't have anything against it really but I don't get the appeal. That said, I think the issue with JPM (and which will be more of an issue with something like SoFi) is that people view what's going on as a potential slowdown.

""all of them are down about 5%. So lost about 3k. It keeps going down. ""

It's a bummer that you're down but I think you have to look at it from the standpoint of given the market that we've had in a few weeks, a lot of people are down (I am, too) and how much are you down relative to your risk tolerance, goals, index, etc? The market has bad days, weeks, months and it's never fun by any means but it becomes if someone is very stressed by all this, then they have to make some changes in their portfolio (too much risk and/or too much money in the market.)  To me, this sort of situation where names are increasingly oversold, stuff down 20-30%+ in a month, sentiment horrible on a historic level is when you want to not be overly stressed by the market and instead look around and *gradually* start buying at least a bit of what everyone else is throwing out."

PYPL is in a lot of people's portfolios on here and still not really seeing the appeal: yes, it's cheap but it's cheap because it's a maturing story (TPV growth down over the last 6 quarters, etc.) If they can manage to reboot the growth story, that's something else but it's fintech: what can you really do that hasn't already been done and if there is something that you can do that hasn't already been done, there's nothing keeping a dozsen other players from doing their own version. Plus, Apple Pay as continual competition.

IMO,  a bit too much in mag 7/mega cap tech names and could use at least a little bit further diversification.

In terms of NIO, I don't particularly like the EV theme but I'm always surprised more people don't talk about BYD, who just announced 5 minute charging.  It's one of the very few auto names that have actually done well in recent years. BYD has a foreign ordinary share class (although some brokers charge absurd fees for trading in foreign ordinaries - symbol ends in F) and an ADR in the US."

comment,mhxaaa3,stocks,Rate My Portfolio - r/Stocks Quarterly Thread March 2025,elgrandorado,,2,"Bull thesis comes down to buying a company with proven accretive organic growth with little acquisitions in it's track record. The company has a deal win rate of over 70% while competing in mission critical WMS industry. The company is also expanding into Omni channel enterprise software which expands their SAM. Biggest risk is the macro over the retail industry. 

If the current environment turns into a recession, the company would still be a little overvalued, as their service revenue would drop further (they handle implementations internally as opposed to a company that outsources systems implementation like Oracle). I put money in the company, but am cautious about keeping my money there as I see attractive opportunities like Adobe or buying more of my favorite companies like ASML, MCO, GOOG, and SPGI at current valuations."

Sell a stock for less than you paid, and you can use that loss to lower taxes on your gains. Made $5,000 on one stock but lost $3,000 on another? Sell the loser, and you only pay taxes on $2,000. If losses top gains, you can cut up to $3,000 off your income taxes too. It’s not about liking losses—it’s a strategy to save on taxes. “Never sell at a loss” might overlook this option"

The aforementioned investors you mentioned; Buffett & Graham both made the majority of their returns from holding more than half their portfolio in Geico.

Investing in the S&P500 and diversifying works if you have no idea what you’re doing in the stock market and you don’t want to devote the effort or time into looking into stocks and analysing businesses, which is perfectly fine.

But at the end of the day, over-diversifying and adding additional stocks to your portfolio will diminish the portfolio’s expected return."

Secondly, I already knew the answer to my question, I simply posted that thread to see what the consensus was on this subreddit. If we’re gonna judge each other by our Reddit posts then maybe you should consider investing in an accounting course. HOOD’s accounting for the last quarter included an accrual reversal and deferred tax benefit which is why their earnings were inflated. 


And thirdly, investing data suggests that concentration, not diversification drives the greatest returns if you had bothered to do a little research you dimwit. Diversification merely reduces risk.

This tariff terror is functionally identical to sales tax or VAT (value added tax) that other countries use.  But those countries apply it more carefully and surgically.  And they have measures to reduce how regressive it is.

Our tariff rate is apparently averaging north of 20%, but applies only to the approx half of goods that we import.  So call that 50% of 20%.  

**It means we just put in a 10% sales tax**.  But with no measure to stop it being regressive.

Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) noted that the tariffs make no economic sense because “[t]hey aren’t designed as economic policy. The tariffs are simply a new, super dangerous political tool.” Murphy suggests they are a way to make private industry dependent on the president the same way he has tried to make law firms and universities dependent on him. Industries and companies “will need to pledge loyalty to Trump in order to get sanctions relief.”

Murphy warns that “[t]he tariffs are DESIGNED to create economic hardship…[s]o that Trump has a straight face rationale for releasing them, business by business or industry by industry. As he adjusts or grants relief, it’s a win-win: the economy improves and dissent disappears.”"

These tariffs will trigger a monumental backlash from American toddlers and permanently impair their image of Republicans on the economy. I expect a brutal U. Mich. pre-K sentiment report next month.

Existing inventories should last us until Christmas but the following one could see many empty boxes under the tree. If there even are any Christmas trees to import thanks to the lumber tariffs. If things get so severe, you could see a growing sharing economy, in which American children are forced to share their rare toys with other children, even annoying siblings. It's a grim scenario, but it will at least build some character during these tough times. A whole generation of blue-onsie American children are facing devastation and I can already picture the hollowed out, rusting playgrounds that were once a symbol of American abundance and industrial might."

The input and output price are both getting squeezed the wrong way. This will bankrupt the most leveraged ones and *certainly* lead to more production cuts / idling.

I am feeling SO much schadenfreude because 80% of oil Twitter is total MAGA (including the Canadian oil guys) and their industry is imploding with the guy they desperately wanted.

For so many years, we were lied to that the oil and gas was hamstrung by liberal-led government. Sure, they denied some permits, put stupid blocks on LNG exports.

>Trump’s plan will lead to a significant, $900 billion decline in America’s imports, the Tax Foundation says. That decline will come as consumers shift to American goods — or simply choose not to buy certain items that will become too expensive.

>Nevertheless, Americans won’t be able to avoid paying more as a result of tariffs. America’s average import tax will surge to 19% this year from 2.5% last year — the highest rate since the Smoot-Hawley era in 1933. Fitch Ratings said the rate would rise even higher, sending America’s effective tariff rate to its highest level in more than a century.

>As a result, Americans’ after-tax incomes will decline 2.1% on average this year, the Tax Foundation said. Although no one will escape the tariffs, wealthier Americans’ incomes will decline less, the group found.

>Mainstream economists largely agree the US and global economies will [plunge into a recession this year](https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/tariffs-trump-news-04-02-25#cm90qyswp001x3b6nd1mkndo5) if Trump doesn’t loosen up his new trade policy. The Trump administration has been pushing back on those predictions, arguing Trump’s trade actions in his first term were widely predicted to cause inflation to soar and the economy to slow — neither of which happened.

>However, Trump in his entire first term put in place tariffs on $380 billion worth of goods. Already, Trump has announced tariffs on more than $2.5 trillion of imports, and he has promised more tariffs are on their way."

Key isn’t looking for things that are down a lot, but down without good reason other than “market is angry”

Some I’m noticing...

FCX - it’s basically copper, but a miner, so the stock lags.  Getting blasted because of tariff terrorism, but people haven’t yet realized copper is exempt.  Stock is down 32% YTD but copper commodity has been on a parabolic tear the last few weeks.  IN NORMAL TIMES that would mean FCX stock is due for a huge rally.  Big asterisk on “in normal times”.

FTAI does aviation servicing work, that's not going away with tariffs.  Demand is strong and rising.  Share price got shellacked by short report on accounting, but right when that got cleared up was when the selloff began so it hasn’t had a market in which to get properly repriced.  If you believe things will calm down eventually, FTAI could return closer to former levels $150 range.

UBER - no tariff impact but stock is down 23% from recent top.  Could be the kind of name money flows to from people who still want stock market exposure but no tariff risk.  Higher prices will favor UBER on the rider demand side and bumbling economy will also favor UBER on driver supply. 

DELL - being thrown out with the AI/NVDA bathwater.  Down to covid lows even as there is massive demand for data centers with or without AI.  It’s a profitable and best of breed tech staple trading at around 10x.  That’s absurdly cheap."

>Executives from Intel (INTC) and TSMC (TSM) recently reached a preliminary agreement to form a joint venture to operate Intel’s chipmaking facilities, with TSMC taking a 20% stake in the new company, according to two people involved in some of the discussions, The Information’s Qianer Liu reports. Intel and other U.S. semiconductor companies will hold the majority of the shares in the proposed JV, which would include at least some of Intel’s existing chip foundries, said the two people. In exchange for the 20% stake, TSMC has discussed sharing some of its chipmaking methods with Intel and training Intel personnel to use them, instead of funding its stake with capital, one of the people said."

comment,ml9kud8,stocks,"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Options Trading Thursday - Apr 03, 2025",AP9384629344432,,3,"Crude is down 7%. But you may not have noticed, on the other hand, natural gas in the US is actually +1.5% and still near 2 year highs. Why is that? Shouldn't the prospect of a recession hit demand? Where is the oversupply/glut?

Answer: US oil industry is getting shellacked by the cost inflation / price. They are *not* going to drill like the administration want. The implication is that the associated gas from crude oil drilling is going to also stop increasing. US shale wells are growing 'gassier' over time. If it is uneconomic to drill more crude, you will get less natural gas as a byproduct.

Thus, all of this is making natural gas **tighter**. ~20-35% of all US gas production is 'associated gas' from oil drilling.

Eventually crude will correct, because you will undershoot production and eventually cause a supply crunch when conditions normalize. That will take more time though. In the meantime, natural gas is looking quite healthy."

It's basically what China did recently to be honest, and they're still having issues digging out of the rut involving real estate.

I knew I'd been overweighting the U.S. for years, but I've decided to go ahead and underweight us because I am immensely bearish on our prospects. It's almost guaranteed the Fed will start raising rates again to try to keep inflation down with price increases. We're barreling for a recession, but if Trump can successfully isolate us, the rest of the world, if not doing superbly, will do better than us.

As spiraling tariff worries hammer US stocks, legendary investor Bill Gross is urging prospective dip-buyers to stay on the sidelines.
The co-founder and former chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Co. said the selloff — which has dragged the S&P 500 down by more than 4% on Thursday — is a “deep market event” with little resolution in sight.
“Investors should not try to ‘catch a falling knife’,” he said in an email. “This is an epic economic and market event similar to 1971 and the end of the gold standard except with immediate negative consequences.”"

Essentially putting tariffs on the countries that have the labor force to produce goods at a low cost to force companies to invest billions to bring jobs back to the USA at a higher cost and not enough workers. Additionally, by taking those jobs away from developed/developing countries, that's less income for those countries to buy goods from the United States (eg: oil, LNG etc)."

Wake up people!  Macro macro macro!

He is in the S and P right now on some stocks, notably out of bank stocks which should tell you a lot, and holds but at valuations far cheaper than now.  He will deploy his cash eventually.

someone tell me im crazy because several articles and news sources say their quarterly earnings were supposed to be released today along with live earnings call - yet no financial statements or any relevant info has been released or reported on sec / edgar / no analysts

the only things i could find were:

speculative articles saying the following keywords: influenced, suggested, signaled

articles saying their earnings were due on 25 April 2025 and another due on 2 may 2025.
so am i crazy or was exxon able to skip out on earnings amidst tariffs, opec ramping up oil supply??? Imk

This was approx 3% off the ATH in US markets. I had a feeling that the administration doesn’t actually care about what happens in the stock market.  They are more concerned about leading through ideology rather than logic or reason.

The last time I did this was in February 2020, the day that Japan shuttered all of their schools I went all cash, and US markets were 12% off the recent high (at this time the ATH of VTI was 172). I was posting on the bogleheads website back then, and went 100% stocks again when VTI was 111.

I’m not suggesting anyone does the same as me.

It is crazy to me that I found myself making the decision this time based on politics (!!!) I never thought that would happen.

Like I keep saying, I have my limit buys in place to automatically go 100% stocks again when VTI is 245.99."

The US has done this before—applying pressure to get better trade deals. If other countries play ball, markets will rally, and deals will be done fast because most economies still need access to the US.

But if they retaliate instead, then yes we’re looking at a drawn-out trade war It all depends on how the other side responds. But imo larger economies will fold eventually and quickly."

Unless you really, really need the money now, it’s often best to just hold. You and I millennials will not be retiring any time soon. You gotta ride the wave and let things compound, my brother. That’s how wealth gets built. 

In 2020, people were losing their minds, but I bought a bunch of ETFs and BRKB. Things can recover and market panic often ends up being overblown. 

Statistically speaking, most retail investors are god awful at timing the market. Most end up selling low and buying high"

https://globalnews.ca/video/11114051/if-the-u-s-no-longer-wants-to-lead-canada-will-carney-proposes-global-free-trade-coalition

In a speech that felt part campaign rally, part obituary for American leadership, Mark Carney-Canada's next prime minister if polling holds-didn't just respond to Trump's economic firebombs. He redefined the moment. Calmly.
Directly. And in plain language the whole world could hear:

""The global economy is fundamentally different today than it was yesterday. The system of global trade anchored on the United States... is over.""

Carney didn't hedge. Didn't soften. He flat-out declared that the 80-year era of American-led economic order is done, and Canada is preparing to take its rightful place-not as a sidekick-but as a new global leader for democratic nations that still believe in rules, partnerships, and actual adults running the show.

""Our old relationship of steadily deepening integration with the United States is over. The 80-year period when the United States embraced the mantle of economic leadership... is over. While this is a tragedy, it is also the new reality."""

Canada doesn’t have the scale and is frankly a lot less financially healthy than we are.  They’re kind of their own economic basket case, and a trade war will hurt them disproportionately more than us.

As sickening as it is, Mexico’s leader seems to be more shrewd.  She’s not taking any bait and waiting for the toddler to calm himself.  No escalation or retaliation.  It’s morally unfair that anyone would have to do this and condone him.  But in the end her approach will probably be the most pragmatic.  There’s always time for her to punch back.

Its a risky message to send though because the last thing the canadian housing market needs is more millionaires showing up to use Canada's housing as a stock market.


I'm interested to see how Canada and the E.U. Will grow their domestic tech sectors and grow partnerships with exporters. The boogeymanning of china for example needs to end. It's a massive exporter that has a growing appetite for importers. They aren't the Soviet union and they're not ideologically committed to spreading their world view. They just want money. They'll do business with anyone they don't care. Other countries need to use that to their advantage while building domestic capacity and industries. More competition in business, and greater buying power for citizens is beneficial to everyone. It leads to innovation, drives down prices, and improves quality overall.  It's not like this is secret knowledge or an untested bet."

comment,mlba0eq,stocks,"Carney- “If the United States no Longer Wants to Lead, Canada Will""",Puzzleheaded_Mud7917,,1,"What he produced was a graph of the rate of growth, and you countered with a graph of absolute growth, which shows a lack of even basic understanding of macroeconomic models. If your economy grows by a fixed number each year, your graph will be a straight diagonal line going up, which an uneducated person might think is a good thing. But what's really happening is that your growth rate is attenuating, as each year the constant amount by which you grow the economy represents a smaller and smaller growth, to the point that growth will be negligible, which means that your economy is stagnating. A growth rate chart does not have this problem, it shows you precisely whether an economy has been growing, stagnating or contracting, and it gives you a visual depiction of the magnitude of growth/contraction.

Furthermore, growth rates and logarithmic graphs nomralize metrics and are invariant to scale. The absolute graph is precisely the reason growth is a more meaningful metric to compare economies by. The US economy is much larger than any other country's, we know that. That's all the absolute chart tells you. The growth rate chart gives you information on how much each country has actually been growing their economy. If the US adds 1 trillion to their economy, it's not as meaningful as if Canada does. An absolute chart would represent both countries adding 1T as an equal shift upwards, whereas the growth rate chart would represent the difference in magnitude of 1T in a much steeper Canadian curve, which would accurately show you that in relative terms the Canadian economy outperformed the US economy."

Canada doesn’t pretend to be as economically or militarily powerful as the USA. Nor do we think the only way to be powerful is to pretend to be the USA.

We understand something else: there’s such thing as soft power. The USA used to know this. That’s how you guys were so hegemonic without having to conquer people. Under Trump, you’re making everyone your enemy. All Canada is doing is recognizing that.

Take for example the EU’s economy. Take any one country, and yeah, there’s no comparison to the USA. Take the whole block, and now things get spicy. Canada understands that cooperation and soft power with allies and collaborators, if handled well, amounts to a lot of power: military and economically.

We can absolutely be a leader in that context. It’s not about outdoing the USA all on our own."

There's also retail traders, who remember full well how quickly the covid crash recovered and perhaps they missed out.

My best guess is that for the next two years we'll see small green days, followed by one huge red day that wipes out all those gains and more. If you look at a yearly chart you'll see straight trend down, but on a weekly chart it will be the extremely choppy.

comment,ml7rbqx,stocks,How low can it go?,Teraninia,,8,"The global financial system revolves around the US providing global liquidity through running a high trade deficit. Tariffs will unwind this, creating a liquidity crisis, and it's under those conditions that normally central bankers step in and inject liquidity, which would be a boon for stocks. The problem is that tariffs also create inflation (where inflation is defined as rising consumer prices), and global demand for US debt is disappearing, so if you inject liquidity into those conditions, you risk hyperinflation.

So it's risky not having any assets and just holding cash, because cash itself is in the verge of becoming a risk asset. But it's also risky holding stocks for obvious reasons, and it's also risky holding anything that could potentially disappear in the wake of a financial crisis induced by the tariffs, like gold ETFs, for example."

comment,ml8joq6,stocks,How low can it go?,MakkaCha,,2,"I think you'd have to look in the past before 2000s to see the picture. 

Here is an excerpt from Wikipedia of the Great Depression. 
>  By 1929, declining spending had led to reductions in manufacturing output and rising unemployment. Share values continued to rise until the October 1929 crash, after which the slide continued until July 1932, accompanied by a loss of confidence in the financial system. By 1933, the U.S. unemployment rate had risen to 25%, about one-third of farmers had lost their land, and 9,000 of its 25,000 banks had gone out of business. President Herbert Hoover was unwilling to intervene heavily in the economy, and in 1930 he signed the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act, which worsened the Depression.

Many industry(hotel, restaurants, specialty) works still have not recovered post covid. On top of that the firing of thousands of federal workers and ICE picking off any field workers has exasperated the strain of labor shortage. These shortage are not immediately filled because of stagnant pay rate. Some people can't afford to work for low income.

Farmers instead of losing land to debt are losing money because we don't produce what is needed to feed people. Instead outside of California, all farmers hedged their bet on feeding cattle.

And then there is the dumbass enacting tariffs, so his buddies don't have to pay taxes. He really believes that foreign countries pay the import tax and that will make up for lost revenue by not taxing the rich. 

Then there is the alienating our allies and threatening annexation of our allies. 

I honestly believe this is the tip of the iceberg and it's down hill for a while. It's going to take a few years-decades to recover but that's just my guess. I am not a historian nor a economist."

Earnings are likely to drop a fair bit and so even if multiple remain high we could see a fairly big decline.  But if forward P/E multiples fall to more historical levels the market could be in for a world of hurt.

Personally I don't think it will drop catastrophically.  There is simply too much cash out there and too much more forward-looking and deeper drops will be bought fairly aggressively.  But we could still get into market crash territory if the trade war does not end any time soon."

comment,ml8hs6x,stocks,How low can it go?,TheNplus1,,1,"First, IMHO there is no practical way all these tariffs stay on at these levels. Building a factory (of any kind) takes years and the US, like any other country on the planet, imports A LOT of stuff from A LOT of places. I don’t see how the country can continue to function in total isolation until the hypothetical re-industrialisation happens (which is a stupid idea anyway because the jobs that are being outsourced are always low income / low margin ones, but whatever).

Since the tariffs cannot possibly stay in place at these levels and therefore cut the US off from all imports, the question is how much will they drop and how fast.

Assuming Trump is dumb enough to force the country in a self inflicted recession / depression, don’t forget he has midterms in less than 2 years and I can’t imagine Trump staying in power with all the damage he’s doing, especially to his voter base.

With all this into consideration, no matter how low it goes, this feels very much like 2020 to me."

comment,ml9d7jc,stocks,How low can it go?,Lucy_Goosey_11,,1,"From the Economist:

On economics Mr Trump’s assertions are flat-out nonsense. The president says tariffs are needed to close America’s trade deficit, which he sees as a transfer of wealth to foreigners. Yet as any of the president’s economists could have told him, this overall deficit arises because Americans choose to save less than their country invests — and, crucially, this long-running reality has not stopped its economy from outpacing the rest of the g7 for over three decades. There is no reason why his extra tariffs should eliminate the deficit. Insisting on balanced trade with every trading partner individually is bonkers — like suggesting that Texas would be richer if it insisted on balanced trade with each of the other 49 states, or asking a company to ensure that each of its suppliers is also a customer.

And Mr Trump’s grasp of the technicalities was pathetic. He suggested that the new tariffs were based on an assessment of a country’s tariffs against America, plus currency manipulation and other supposed distortions, such as value-added tax. But it looks as if officials set the tariffs using a formula that takes America’s bilateral trade deficit as a share of goods imported from each country and halves it — which is almost as random as taxing you on the number of vowels in your name."

This time around though, if we see very large GDP declines, private sector employment losses (we can pretty much ignore the latest public sector losses since they’re not in response to economic shocks), high unemployment rates, and any of the similar hallmarks of recessions, it’s possible it could be here a lot longer.

These kinds of actions are only attempted every 100 years because everyone who remembers the last one has to be dead to try it again.

I think the question is less about uncertainty. Anyone with 2 brain cells to rub together knows that this is going to be bad. What they don't realize is that because of the last 80 years of global integration centered on the US our economic outlook is quickly going to look cataclysmic. **This is not hyperbole.** GDP estimates from the Atlanta Fed for Q1 have been poor (approximately -3%). I would not be surprised to see future outlooks for GDP to plummet to -10% on an annualized basis per quarter.

We are still likely to see unemployment rising and inflation rising in the short to medium term. Places like Walmart squeeze the soul out of margins, and those prices are going nowhere but up.

The Senate is a lost cause until 2028 at the earliest. The Democrats need four Republican seats, and to defend every Democratic stay. That means defending: Colorado, Georgia, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Virginia. Then they have to flip four Republican seats, probably these four based on 2020 margins of victory: North Carolina (Thom Tillis 1.8%), Iowa (Joni Ernst 6.6%), Maine (Susan Collins 6.7%), Texas (John Cornyn 9.6%).

That is all 100% off the table now.  I'll continue to contribute to retirement and DCA a little bit into taxable accounts, but every other cent is going under the proverbial mattress.  Even if the stock market recovers, there is too much uncertainty and potential for ruin while Trump is in office.  No more big discretionary purchases, capital preservation is the name of the game until he is gone."

Speaking aboard Air Force One, he defended the tariff strategy, asserting that the economic turbulence would settle and expressing satisfaction with falling interest rates. This stance follows the administration’s imposition of a 10% minimum tariff on all U.S. trading partners, with higher rates for specific countries, aiming to address perceived trade imbalances.

I'm saying that our Congress should be restraining this POTUS but they aren't doing their frickin jobs. Trump's erratic and capricious mistreatment of the rest of the world (which includes some really nefarious people with power) is making a target out of the USA, Americans at home and abroad, and most of all, himself.

Which in turn likely means lower wages and the US being used to produce and export products to the world that means a trade surplus.  Economically it seems like he wants every country to exploit the US workers for cheap labor and goods in return for becoming a manufacturing powerhouse like the past.  Basically coerce other countries with tariffs to bring their manufacturing to the US, remove unionization for cheaper labor and rebuild the economy to compete with China.  The problem is likely going to be a brain drain in the US which also makes manufacturing an easier sell.  If manufacturing does come back to the US, it will benefit other countries as US wages will likely fall below other countries that exploit his manufacturing plan.  For all we know he might want half of the working force in the US to be in manufacturing."

Because logistics.


Even with UBER TARIFF, it's still going to be cheaper buying and trading with the US, just due to the size of market and transportation fee.


Canada will diversify from the US, but it won't be a massive disconnect, that's just the way the supply chain and geography crumbles.


How would we know this? We already have near free trade with EU, CETA was established in 2016, which removes 98% of tariff between CA and EU, US remains our number one export and import partner.


For trade to be worth it on a monetary level, the tariff needs to be China level, it needs to be more than 25%.


That doesn't mean we won't give the US the middle finger thou, companies will likely split export, and when exporting large value goods or services, where the transportation becomes marginal, EU will be considered before US due to... *Gestures the chaos*"

post,1jqvrje,stocks,"Tariffs on semiconductors will be starting ""very soon""",Fidler_2K,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqvrje/tariffs_on_semiconductors_will_be_starting_very/,466,"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/03/business/trump-tariffs

> President Trump said Thursday he would unveil additional tariffs on imported semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, he said the chip tariffs are “starting very soon,” and that the pharma-related tariffs are “under review right now.”

There was speculation that semiconductors would be left out, it looks like they will be separate from the tariffs that went into effect today

Impacted companies off the top of my head would be TSMC, Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, Qualcomm, Micron, and SK Hynix

But I don't think fabless chip designers really have any options outside of TSMC for cutting edge chips, so at least in the short to medium term I don't see designers flipping to other fabs. 

ASML is another one, unless these tariffs absolutely tank demand for chips (which is certainly plausible), I don't see much impact to them because there are no other alternatives

Biggest hit would be to companies in SMH, but pretty much every industry would be impacted. For example, every company relies on a cloud service provider. Cloud service providers would have to pass on the costs of increased compute costs to customers. A more direct example is consumer electronics. Phones, laptops, TVs etc all require chips and will become more expensive. Same for cars.

The tariffs on chips don’t make any sense. TSMC is the only company capable of advanced chip production and they’re investing more in the U.S. Intel is trying to become more viable and rumour is they’ll sign a deal with TSMC.

A better question for you guys might be what is the end game? What's the point of this? Everyone knows what is happening. The question is what will happen. It's far more important

Because there's really two main scenarios. The first one is. This garbage tariff chart they didn't really want to waste any time on because it's not designed to stay in place very long. Why are they doing this? There's only a couple of reasons I can think of. Create a recession, drive down rates. See the inflation only happens if these stay on. If they filter into pricing. If they do stay on. If that is the plan, it's likely to be far worse than a recession. You start talking more around the realm of s&p 2500 there's a extremely major support. Somewhere in that zone. It would be a virtual repeat of the 2001 to 2002 market with a 24-month downtrend that only ends with a wipeout in the midterms and thus probably the ability to reverse a lot of this damage. 

I mean do you guys really think that later scenario is possible? It would cost Republicans elections for a generation. It would be nothing but market losses, job losses, inflation month after month after month"

The admin thinks a trade deficit (we import more from someone than we export to them) is a bad thing. It just means they have things we need, and they are making them efficiently and cheaply. And more importantly, there is demand for them, flagging strong economic indicators.

Not surprisingly, most of the recent tariffs align perfectly to the trade ratios with those countries. E.g., Cambodia exports $12B to us and we export $300M to them. 300M is about 3% of 12B, so they got a 97% tariff.

comment,ml8nraw,stocks,"Hi guys, can you guys help me understand what Trump has done to the economy with the Tarrifs?",GryffinLoL,,168,"A tariff is essentially a tax placed on goods imported from other countries, meant to encourage consumers to buy domestic products. While \*targeted\* tariffs can, theoretically, help certain American industries in the short-term, they often lead to higher prices on goods—especially everyday products—hurting lower-income Americans most, since they spend a larger portion of their income on necessities.   
  
Over time, tariffs can slow economic growth and create uncertainty, potentially hurting stock market stability. So, the impact isn't just short-term pain; it can create longer-term challenges as well.

Yesterday, Trump essentially announced very steep tariffs against every trade partner in the world, essentially introducing a tax of between 10-60% on pretty much all goods being imported into the United States. The companies that do the importing will, without fail, pass those tax costs down to the consumer - the price of goods will go up.

comment,ml8od7f,stocks,"Hi guys, can you guys help me understand what Trump has done to the economy with the Tarrifs?",UsualLazy423,,40,"Economically tariffs have one proven impact, they reduce the volume of trade between countries, which is bad for companies engaged in trade.

Politically the outcome is less clear. My personal guess is that countries will form new trade alliances and global trade flows will be rerouted to reduce integration with US economy. We already saw Korea, Japan, and China forming a trade alliance. I’d guess more of that happening.

I was talking with a friend in the mining industry and he said US industry is already dependent on imported raw materials, so any expansion of US manufacturing would be even more heavily reliant on imported raw materials impacted by these tariffs. Opening a new mining project takes about 15 years, so it’s not possible to quickly spin up alternative sources within US. He also says that many countries and companies were already looking for reasons not to sell to US and that mining companies are actively hunting to move sales to markets outside of the US, and even if these tariffs get dropped it will likely be too late as companies will have already shifted who they supply to."

He wants interest rates to lower, to stimulate the economy, and he wants to lower the 10 year to reduce the bond market. Crashing the economy will force the Fed to lower interest rates, which will stimulate short term economic activity. Forcing a recession will reduce the 10 year, making longer term capital loans cheaper (mortgages, corporate bonds, etc). This will stimulate investment and growth. He is doing this now to time the recovery in q4 or q1 next year, just in time for the mid terms, where he hopes the republicans can maintain the house and senate. If any of those flips, he will face a much more hostile government, and possible impeachment. What he is not calculating is the amount of distain the world will have towards the US, and the recovery is not guaranteed, particularly if US boycott persists, and alternate trading agreements and supply chains are developed. And if inflation ticks up, the Fed won’t reduce rates. It’s a huge gamble, and I don’t think it will play out as elegantly as I described."

comment,ml8n591,stocks,"Hi guys, can you guys help me understand what Trump has done to the economy with the Tarrifs?",Mithrandir_1019,,17,"President Trump recently introduced new tariffs on imports in 2025. These tariffs are basically taxes on products coming into the U.S. from other countries. Almost all imported goods now have a 10% tax added, and some countries are being hit with even higher rates like 20% for the European Union, 24% for Japan, and 17% for Israel.

The reason behind these tariffs is to push companies to bring manufacturing and production back to the U.S. The idea is that this will help create more American jobs and strengthen the economy at home.

However, these tariffs are also expected to make everyday goods more expensive. Economists estimate that the average American household could end up paying around $1,350 more per year because of higher prices on things like clothes, electronics, and groceries.

The tariffs may also cause inflation to rise above 4%, which means prices for a lot of things could go up. There’s also concern that this could slow down the economy and possibly lead to a recession.

The stock market didn’t react well to the news. The S&P 500 dropped by 5%, and the NASDAQ fell by 10%. Investors are worried that these tariffs could hurt company profits and shake up the economy.

Lastly, these new trade rules could damage relationships with other countries. Some of them might respond with tariffs of their own, which could lead to a global trade war."

It’s a huge question mark, and nobody has a crystal ball to know how it’ll turn out in a few years."

comment,ml8q3qf,stocks,"Hi guys, can you guys help me understand what Trump has done to the economy with the Tarrifs?",JPMorgansStache,,4,"On the surface, the talking point from the President and his enablers is that this will eventually make it untenable for importers to sell things from other countries, and thus as a result compel them to build, manufacture, and make things purely in America. One layer below this surface is where most of the criticisms of the policy come from saying that Americans can't afford any short term economic pain from this even if the theory would come to fruition causing some kind of boom of domestic production months or years from now.

Astonishingly, though, even the ardent detractors against Trump's direction on tariffs seem to act as if they believe HE thinks this will be \*good\* for the American economy or the so-called ""working class."" This to me is the greatest and most dangerous flaw in thinking. Donald Trump, with his family cryptocurrency firm owned by himself and his sons, and ""envoy"" Steve Witkoff (and his sons) called World Liberty Financial made it clear in their ""Gold Paper"" a year or so ago, that their penultimate economic plan is to replace the Federal Reserve with their own decentralized banking system.

Elon Musk, under the liability shield of DOGE, has effectively seized control of almost all digital infrastructure related to our nation's money from the Treasury, SEC, and other institutional safeguards against both corruption and inflation itself. They are essentially creating rat holes, skimmers, and other means to steal taxpayer dollars while devaluing our currency to replace it with their own. Trump's typical self-dealing has transformed into an internationally untenable, farcical nightmare as a result of this. The exact percentage of tariffs, whether reciprocal or not, are a distraction.

The real crime is being committed on the routing of funds from Importers -> CBP -> The US General Fund (controlled by the Treasury) and however Trump, Musk, and their cronies have established the shadow banking system to loot all of our money.

DOGE was the first step in this process, to begin confusing Americans about the distinction, differences, and separation of privately held cryptocurrencies and USD.

Since the announcement of this project, have been other projects for that same end:

• TRUMPcoin

• renaming United States Digital Service to the US DOGE Service

• World Liberty Financial establishing a USD1 ""stablecoin""

As the world reels from the actual impact of legitimate tariffs, underneath the surface, the President and his henchmen are robbing us all blind.

World Liberty Financial, it should be noted also, has been integral in a variety of treasonous and internationally reprehensible actions:

1) Claiming the U.S. will ethnically cleanse Gaza and turn it into condominiums.

2) Extorting the Ukrainians with an unnecessary rare Earth mineral deal and suggesting that the capital grants for weaponry during the war against Russia were actually loans.

3) SignalGate revealed a plan to have Europeans ""pay"" for the bombing campaign on the Houthis in Yemen, a conversation which Mr. Witkoff was involved with for no  legitimate reason.

Therefore, I recommend people reevaluate their position and feelings on the matter of tariffs, because if you are opposed to them, you should know what's happening behind the scenes and the **real** reasoning for them. It is not American prosperity.

On the other hand, even if you support the rationale of tariffs as a means to exert economic will on other countries, know that they are not going to be levied in a way such that they do what Trump or his advisors say they will. They are not for **us** at all."

In theory, short term pain can improve long-term economic prosperity within a narrow product category.

There are two unorthodox (not completely new, but very unusual) features to Trump's purported approach to tariffs:  
\- They are sweeping (both in terms of the nations being targeted and products having tariffs applied)  
\- They are being used as much or more in the vein of ""economic warfare"" than to promote domestic growth

Most economic experts, be they from the Keynesian or Austrian school of economics, largely agree the tariffs will be a net detriment to American consumers along both short and long terms, since they are unlikely to make a noticeable positive impact on domestic production."

Yes, businesses aren't happy because their costs are going up immediately. They now have to figure out how to handle the added cost of production overseas.

Long-term, if tariffs stay, more production will have to come to the United States (at higher labor costs), but prices can be helped by the fact that more people would have more money to spend; due to the increase in jobs/wages, which allows manufacturers to produce at scale, and lower costs.

Short-medium term, as long as nothing changes, the market probably continues going red. We were already in rough economic conditions and have likely been in a technical recession without it being ""officially"" reported. Prices are heavily inflated due to poor financial management and continuously increasing spending.

Longer term, either the next administration revokes the tariffs, or other countries negotiate the end of the tariffs. If the tariffs stay and production moves to the US (would likely take years), the market will eventually stabilize at a lower level and slowly move upwards again. Prices would likely be higher, but wages also likely higher (more jobs needing to be filled means higher wage offerings).





The reality here is that Trump probably isn't thinking economically. This is most likely a strategic play to make the US more self-sufficient. He sees the writing on the wall, and we currently produce almost nothing of our own.

If war with China or another major power were to break out, we don't have the capability of producing supplies and vehicles on our own. Most of the inputs/parts come from China, Vietnam, India, etc, on boats, so it simply isn't a sustainable path for a major power."

These tariffs will hit China the most. Chinese economy is very reliant on the USA market. The EU and US markets are the richest in the world and if Chinese lose a single of them, they gonna feel a huge impact. Remember they have risen their economies to quite the level, already looking at the wages close to eastern Europe in some regions of China, they also invested a lot too look like the western world and built a lot of the western like buirocracy and various institutions. For them they are trying to live like the western countries, but they do so mainly on the production capacity and the trade. 

They can maintain this live style and level of developement mainly because of the EU and US markets, manufacturing plants and technology. So if their production margin risen very close to some European countries, they cant really lower those margins without reducing their current development. Also, a lot of their services are still government driven and paid by government. So its very expensive to keep the country going. They do not really have a healthy local market... So I believe its really gonna be a huge mega blow to them. They basically loosing the most important market. 

China is where all the inflated dollars ended up, it may look strong and powerful, but they do so mainly because they could trade with USA.  Its a giant on the clay legs.

comment,ml94ib0,stocks,"Hi guys, can you guys help me understand what Trump has done to the economy with the Tarrifs?",TheGoteTen,,3,"The US has a trade deficit with the world to the tune of 1.2 TRILLION DOLLARS per year.

One of the reasons American products might be overlooked is foreign tariffs increase the cost of American products to foreign consumers.  

The US has very low tariffs compared to most it's trading partners.  Some trading partners have tariffs that are 100% or even 200% more than the US.

Trump has increased tariffs to bring parity between the tariffs the US  is charged and the tariffs that are imposed on it by other countries. 

It will take time to see if this approach will result in significant improvement to the US economy.  The risk is that it results in stagnation and inflation (stagflation) and cause more harm than good.  It will definitely impact the economy negatively in the short term. 

Some people don't like Trump.  Some very rich people don't like what these tariffs are doing to their stock portfolios.  Most world governments don't like economic uncertainty.  Lots of countries and industries are used to making lots of money selling to the US and they don't like that the market and their profits are at risk.

The US is over 33 Trillion dollars in debt and its adding 2-3 trillion dollars every year.

The US had erased debt to almost NOTHING under Bill Clinton.

I mean Trump appointees.

The tariffs are meant to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and generate revenue. The anticipated timeline for any new manufacturing jobs to come back is a minimum of 2 years. The cost of living in America is also higher, therefore the cost of producing the goods here will require up front investment and ultimately higher long-term prices. The revenue that will be generated is due to YOU AND ME paying more for the same products now and in the future.

Reciprocal tariffs are effectively a tax on doing business internationally due to higher costs and more complex pipeline. More expensive business operations translates to less profit and slower GDP growth. This can ONLY have a negative effect."

comment,ml8ucz2,stocks,"Hi guys, can you guys help me understand what Trump has done to the economy with the Tarrifs?",LessImprovement8580,,1,"Here is the Goldilocks scenario (unrealistic IMO):

The tariffs work as intended and more manufactures/investors invest in production in North America. Inflation will tick up in the short term because tariffs are essentially a tax on imported goods (and the US imports A LOT of goods). The Fed's data shows inflation but not enough to raise rates to address it. The deficit may be reduced due to extra revenue generated by tariffs and growing wages.

Here is the ok scenario:

Tariffs hurt the sp500 and domestic and international economy a bit but do not crash markets dramatically. There are some winners (North American auto/auto parts manufactures, for example) and some losers (retailers that import a lot of goods from Asia). More of a stagflation situation.

Here is the worst case scenario:

The tariffs cause big disruptions to the US economy and SP500. US trading partners retaliate with tariffs of their own. God forbid any major war breaks out. The Fed will lower rates, markets will crash, lots of defaults on debt, mortgages and high unemployment. All the talk about reducing the deficit will go out the window."

However, when they are applied the way they have been in this scenario it does two things, make things significantly more expensive which will ultimately be the burden of the consumer and encourage a trade war. 

Think of it this way. You own a tee shirt making company and sell shirts for $10. It costs you $8 to make the shirt so you profit $2 for every shirt you sell. Tariffs go into place and now it costs you $9 to make the same shirt because you buy your tee shirts from overseas. You’re not going to sell that same shirt for $10 anymore because you wouldn’t want to lose out on the dollar you were making before. So now the consumer has to spend $11 for the same shirt. 

Now..the consumer starts to think, “do I really need to buy that tee shirt?” That leads to a decrease in spending and a shrinking economy. This leads to layoffs from your company because you aren’t making as much money as before and can’t pay your tee shirt makers. This leads to the tee shirt makers who just got laid off to start to question their discretionary spending which leads to a smaller economy…this is why the market is a blood bath today

The argument that the tariffs will make America more reliable on opening up their own manufacturing plants and produce everything “in house” doesn’t make sense either because it doesn’t take into account the capital required to open all of these new manufacturing plants, train people to run them and take into account the lag in time. There has been a video or Reagan explaining this and he makes a good point that when you only rely on domestically made goods it slows innovation and a lot of the industries will rely on government support (will the GOP scream socialism like they do at everything else?) and then when they eventually are reintegrated into the global market, they are way behind"

US has GDP of 27 trillion.

This basically means in a 30 trillion-dollar market of ""stuff"" for consumer, 10% of the stuff just got 20\~30%+ more expensive.

And this isn't taking into consideration things like irreplicable material and supply chain issue. You know why Senate is trying to stop the Canada tariff? Because you can't replace the potash + uranium supply in short amount of time.

When things like primary shit is non-replaceable (i.e cheaper alternative supplier), everything that uses said product will just get however much more expensive.

Theres a reason production has moved to other countries, because its cheaper.

If I employ a US employee with a 14 dollar minimum wage, the item he makes has to be ATLEAST 15 dollars, and you factoring every other cost, its now 20 dollar minimum to just make a dollar.

But if I employ a chinese or indian in their country, you factoring currency difference, and suddenly, im paying 3\~4 dollars, even with shipping costs (which gets lower and lower with scale) and suddenly, I can afford to sell it at 10 dollars, and still make a good profit.

Trump has basically just nuked the cheap stuff people like, while simultaneously jack up all secondary processing products with global supply chain (like phones and cars)"

Companies will decide what manufacturing to move to the US if that’s even an option. Auto makers are already stopping work in Canada and Mexico.  That will stop work US for those components.  

All parts for US made goods will go up.  US made finished goods will go up accordingly.  

Many products are simply not made in the us and will not be made here.  Those costs will go up.

1, we are already near peak employment... where will he get allt he people from? unless he crash the economy on purpose and literally drop everyone's income by half.

2, manufactering needs CHEAP labor, when you can make more working in mcdonalds, who is going to work less on a assembly line? unless you crash the economy hard and make salary 4 dollar per hour while massive unemployment.

3. even IF you manage to make stuff in US, then it is still NOT competitive with China in the overseas market... so your only market are selling to Americans... who are by now poorer, and with less money to buy more expensive goods.

4. trump is putting universal tariff on all imports... guess what items are required to brign back manufactering to america? CHEAP raw materials, and he is putting tariff on them as well, aka steel, so how are you going to bring back manufactering when you make the basic cost of building things expensive?

5. if you achieve all of the above, we are literally going to wall america off from the rest of the world... we will be like the USSR economy.. fun

6. and most imporatnly... wtf is going to happen to the dollar? dollar is the reserve currency, people trust it becasue it is open and with few restriction, and most imortantly.. foreigner EARN dollar  by sellign goods to america... if trump successfully builds a closed off economy... there will be no dollar supply to the rest of the world.. i mean sure the rest of the world will suffer, but eventually the rest of the world will find an alernative.

comment,ml9hase,stocks,"Hi guys, can you guys help me understand what Trump has done to the economy with the Tarrifs?",RJG-98,,1,"I think it’s important to get a level view of what tariffs are and what these changes mean.

Tariffs are taxes or duties imposed on imported products. They are used to protect domestic industries, encourage local production, generate government revenue, reduce reliance on foreign goods or respond to trade policies of other nations. 

What is their potential impact?
-tariffs raise prices for consumers, affect trade relationships with other countries and influence economic growth

The average US tariff rate has been significantly lower in the past 40 years due to trade agreements, economic policy shifts and expansion of global supply chains

For much of US history, tariffs were THE way our government produced revenue. After the implementation of the 16th amendment in 1913, tariffs only have made around 2% of the revenue. The rest has came from taxing us as citizens. 

Example-US tariff revenue tripled from 2017 to 2022, largely due to the introduced tariffs in 2018. By 2024, they dropped to $77B as trade patterns and imports adjusted.

The USA has the lowest simple average tariffs rates of its top 10 trading partners at 3.3%. EU is 5%, China 7.5% and Mexico at 6.8%

Overall Trade as a Share of State GDP
- look up a map of this. It shows that for the USA, imports/exports only account for an average of 16% of each states GDP. The largest being Louisiana mainly due to it’s petroleum exports

Import values of US top Trading partners
-Mexico is leading at $476B
-China $427B
-Canada $421B
-China used to be the biggest exporter to the US but over the years, the tariffs have affected their ability to export to the USA. 

Value of Top 5 Imported Products
-motor vehicle parts - mainly Mexico
-computers and phones-China and Mexico
-crude oil- Canada
-cars-rest of the world followed by Mexico and then Canada

Exports as Shares of GDP - US and top 5 trading partners
- USA / 11% of GDP
-China / 20% of GDP
-Japan / 22% of GDP
-Canada / 33% of GDP
-Mexico / 36% of GDP
-Germany / 43% of GDP

what this information tells me is that only a fraction of the USAs GDP comes from exports whereas it plays a bigger role in countries like mexico and Canada. They need US as the main consumers of the world to keep up. It also tells me that we have been getting screwed.   We charge 3.3% on imports, yet Mexico charges 6.8%. So not only do we make less, we also lose the jobs for the car industry as it’s more advantageous to make them in Mexico and then import them to the USA. There has to be a downturn before things can pick up. But it’s a play made to correct decades of running this country inefficiently. We need to bring back manufacturing for things like cars and technology. It’s what made our country great in the first place. Overtime, there is a scenario where revenue from tariffs reverses and becomes the leading revenue stream for the US. At this point we could discuss lowering income tax, which would ultimately give you more power on what and where your money goes. Things may cost more, but you as the consumer have the final say in where you put your money. It’s not just taken out of your paycheck and thrown overseas to fund wars we have no business being apart of. It’s an America first policy, one we haven’t seen in a very long time. Like I said, I do see short term declines but I think it has the opportunity to turn into something great"

comment,ml9p5kl,stocks,"Hi guys, can you guys help me understand what Trump has done to the economy with the Tarrifs?",Salaas,,1,"Simplest way to explain it is this.

The US has erected a economic wall around itself against the entire world and it's starting to rain.

The tariffs by Trump are a tax on US people and companies so they will suffer most both short term and long term, here's why.

Short term

Imports won't suddenly disappear, they'll just be more expensive, in some cases they'll still be cheaper than domestic or have no domestic replacement.

Although some domestic supply will increase a certain amount will be due to product that was deemed too expensive to export now due to reciprocal tariffs or reduced demand overseas. So not as many jobs will be generated as you'd think.

Factor in jobs lost with layoffs due to lost demand for US exports thats dont have domestic demand and there is a chance you could see a break even on the jobs.

Though this assumes demand meets supply and people can afford the higher prices. Considering a high number of people are living paycheck to paycheck and heavily in debt too, there's a higher risk of demand collapse.

Long term
If the tariffs and uncertainty in the US remain long term, supply chains will change, products that can be sourced outside the US without the reciprocal tariffs will see a pick up and products that initially didn't have alternatives will eventually have ones pop up as people see opportunities. So US based companies will lose market share and hence layoffs.
There will still be some US products that won't be replaced so determining those will be the stocks to pick.

Within the US the same will happen, with cost of imports risen it will make some products economically viable to produce within the US so new production will appear, how much depends on state of the economy and demand.

Longer term
If say after 4 years a new administration rolls back everything, there will be some bounce in the market and some export increase but it will be muted as supply chains are very slow to change without major shocks, and this wouldnt be a exception. Add to it that changes take time and companies will fight to keep the market share.
So alot of lost market share won't be recovered at all for US companies.

On the flip side if things are not rolled back then economic growth will depend strongly on domestic affairs, though gutting of regulators and education have their own negative effects long term.

Ultimately the republican claims are pie in the sky. The US has started a trade war with the entire world so while every import to the US has suddenly gotten more expensive for the rest of the world imports from only one country will get more expensive depending on how they react to the tariffs. Hence supply chain changes as competitors outside the US take advantage.

Sounds doom and gloom but trade wars do that."

comment,ml9q2re,stocks,"Hi guys, can you guys help me understand what Trump has done to the economy with the Tarrifs?",Utterlybored,,1,"Companies (almost all are American companies in the current Trump context) trying to import goods into the US must pay extra money. Importers then have to decide whether to eat the tariff (reducing their profits, often below their break even profit margin) or pass the costs on to the consumer.

This raises prices for the consumer (inflation). Countries retaliating with tariffs of their own similarly raise prices on American goods, which depresses demand for American exports (recessionary). This means American exports shrink, which leads to American layoffs (unemployment, bankruptcies).

It gives incentive to bring manufacturing back to the US, but the investment needed depends on stability of future economic conditions (loss of investment), supply chains and labor costs. Unless American labor costs plummet, American manufactured good will be more expensive than pre-tariffed foreign goods (inflation) and will make American exports uncompetitive in the global markets (unemployment, bankruptcies).

It creates big imbalances in global trade, which robs consumers of affordable goods (anti-consumer, inflationary) and removes the efficiencies provided by a global marketplace for lowest priced goods (inflationary)."

Tariffs have been found time and time again to be massively ineffecient in terms of global production and actual prices for consumers. There is technically some merit in protectionism and encouraging local development, but for that to happen you would need a consistent policy for 20+ years and it would be more efficient to provide subsidies than it is to tariff people. 

At present the tariffs are an excuse to raise money from trump’s tax cuts for the very rich, and will in effect do little beyond crash the economy from making things more expensive for the general consumer and making it so multiple businesses can no longer do business with the extra costs, to say nothing of any incoming retaliatory tariffs.

comment,mla0lxg,stocks,"Hi guys, can you guys help me understand what Trump has done to the economy with the Tarrifs?",theTrueLodge,,1,"The way I understand it is this. Government places tariffs on imported goods. The American business pays that tariff when they import. They pass that cost onto the wholesaler and the retailer and ultimately the consumer. The consumer makes a decision to continue buying the item. If they decide to stop buying the item, demand for the item slows, and that affects the GDP of the international company. However, if the American consumer continues to buy it at the higher rate, it is the American consumer that is now paying the tariff to the American government. The foreign country continues to make the same amount of money unless they reduce the cost of item to offset the tarriff, which is probably not gonna happen. If the idea is to impose these new tariffs to offset tax cuts specifically for the wealthy/corporate classes, they will eventually be paid for by the American consumer.

There is a school of thought that if demand for international products slows, it could be replaced by American manufacturing, and that this would revitalize our economy in this way. I don’t see this happening in a relatively short time. And therefore, long-term game could be really long-term."

comment,mla3crq,stocks,"Hi guys, can you guys help me understand what Trump has done to the economy with the Tarrifs?",Intrepid_Result8223,,1,"The US is a net importer. That means it imports more than it exports. It is the 'consumer' of the world. Other countries are the 'producers'. You can visualize this as a 'flow' streaming towards the USA. The USA has high buying power.

Trump has enacted tarrifs, which are barriers to import. This means everything sold _to_ the USA is now taxed extra. The person paying this tax is the person exporting the thing into America. This is also called 'protectionism'. In effect the 'flow' of goods will stop streaming toward the USA and probably slow down or reverse, meaning the USA will become a net _exporter_.

This does a couple of things:
- Everything in the USA that comes from outside the US will become more expensive.
- The US will need to source things locally wherever possible. This will stimulate the internal market. Americans will buy American.
- It will concentrate power of American conglomerates.
- American companies can serve their own market without competing with overseas companies.
- Some things that the US can not produce will become really really expensive. Things like oil, minerals ore etc. This is likely why Trump is eyeing Canada and Greenland.
- The US will _lose_ buying power. The dollar will depreciate against all currencies. This will likely see international countries invest elsewhere.
- Some companies that need to serve the US market will move their production there. This means an increase in jobs. However this is likely purely to offset the tarrifs.
- Most countries will likely retaliate. This means it will become much harder for the US to export.
- In summary, the US will look much more internally and serve its own market and retreat somewhat from global trade.
- Other countries will look to form new partnerships, cutting out the US, this will hurt the US.


Now this is all long term stuff. In the short term there will be an incredible supply chain whipsaw disruption effect. All the companies in the US, and the companies dealing with the US will need to recalibrate their entire business plan. Like COVID, this will be extremely disruptive. Depending on the stability of the system and the financial reserves businesses have, probably there will be alot of bankruptcies and/or new initiatives.

However there are forces at play here. The infrastructure of the US, the education of it's people and its governmental systems are all important for the US to be able to have the flexibility to deal with this. It might very well be that there is a huge skill gap problem and that nobody really wants to work in factories for minimum wage while the cost of living goes up 15-30%. Or that industries have fallen too far back to compete internationally and will go out of business due to needed economies of scale.

In any event I would count on a 1920's great depression scenario and _hope_ for the better."

Well the real reason is he’s deliberately trying to crash the economy. True tariffs can help make us more competitive domestically if placed strategically and provide soft incentive for companies to develop domestic infrastructure, but this ain’t that. These are blanket tariffs applied effectively at random, so all they will do is make all imports cost more, while pissing of our trading partners incurring retaliatory tariffs making our exports less competitive if they don’t stop trading with us altogether. Or both. Yes tariffs generate revenue for the government, but without knowing how other countries will react it’s difficult to say what the full fiscal impact would be but historically speaking the more tariffs the more the costs outweigh the benefits.

Most farmers are uninterested in pivoting to growing fruits and vegetables because those crops require a lot more work than grain and meat. So we get our grapes and oranges and lettuce from Mexico and South America. Even if farmers did want to pivot to produce, there is not time in this growing season for them to make that change. A lot of seeds are already in the ground. 

We also do not grow our own cocoa, tea, coffee, and especially sugar in enough quantities to meet domestic demand. Puerto Rico grows some of those, and Hawai'i has one coffee farm, but otherwise we import. And we put sugar in *a lot* of our foods. If the price of sugar goes up, the price of basically every pre-made or processed food is going to go up (or we're going to have to deal with things like our ketchup, salad dressing, breakfast cereal, etc, being less sweet). 

Other costs are also going to go up. 

Electronics, for one. Lots of Americans have electronics made in Korea or Japan. Most households probably own at least one or two products made by Samsung, Sony, or Nintendo. Even the chips used in domestic products, like Apple, are made in China. Cars are the same way, with complicated supply lines of parts made here while the car is assembled there and then sold elsewhere. 

Clothing, too. Go check the tags on your wardrobe, most of them were made in Asia. 

Now, this is going to hurt the countries that rely on exports to America. They will impose retaliatory tarriffs on American goods, which means people who were buying our grain, oil, or cars are going to choose to buy something else. But these countries don't have tarriffs on each other, so it's going to hurt them a lot less as they adjust buying patterns. 

By way of example, we're currently going to impose a 46% tariff on Japanese goods, and can reasonably expect them to respond with another high tariff. This is going to mean that the price of a Playstation or Nintendo product is going to skyrocket in the US, and the price of an Xbox is going to skyrocket in Japan. But Japan isn't in a trade war with the EU. So the price of a Playstation is going to be normal in Europe, while, because Trump has declared a trade war on everybody, an Xbox is still going to expensive in Europe. So if you're a European wanting to buy a new console, a Playstation or Switch is going to be cheaper than an Xbox. A Japanese company gets the money, Microsoft loses a sale. 

Or alcohol. The US exports a ton of bourbon to Canada, but Canada has gone on a boycott. They're encouraging each other to buy Canadian rye. So if tarriffs on Kentucky bourbon or California wine make those products more expensive in Europe or Asia, customers there are going to buy Canadian rye or Argentinian wines. Rinse and repeat for the global economy."

If you are poor or wealthy, you really only need the same amount of consumer goods, groceries, gas, clothes, etc. Therefore, the lower wage earners have to spend a larger percentage of their income on these items. This will affect the working and middle class much more than the wealthy. Also, the farmers rely on export markets perhaps more than anyone."

The government using a tariff gives local products and local producers a competitive advantage because foreign items become more expensive. 

this is the theory, but it doesn't always pan out. 

When Trump acts like foreign governments have to pay to sell their products in the US, he is either mislead, or misleading.

Supply and demand can cause a problem for this. Although there are many examples, one of the most obvious ones is lumber. When tariffs are placed on Canadian lumber (Trump is not the first to do this) US producers often hike their price to match the tariff. This widens their profit margin but hurts the consumer and construction industry. They can do this because of the high demand for lumber. 

Another problem is existing infrastructure. Automotive manufacturing can't set up factories overnight. Costs of laying off thousands of long term employees, moving or replacing equipment, etc. 
In other industries, like aluminum, understanding that aluminum smelting is HIGHLY energy intensive. The US already purchases millions of megawatt hours from Canada each year, and is not energy independent. Manufacturing aluminum locally would likely require new powerplants being built. Those are just two examples, but there are significantly more, across many industries, where the infrastructure doesn't exist. 

Cost of goods is what I'd say is the last issue. One of the reasons people can buy a 12 dollar pair of shoes at Wal-Mart is because those goods are manufactured in a place where cheap labour is their main export. Someone making $3/ day with no workers compensation benefits, no mandatory vacation pay, scheduled breaks, etc. Is profoundly cheaper than a minimum wage job locally. Essentially, to move manufacturing some of these goods locally, then the cheap, poor quality, less durable shoes we are used to paying $12 for would suddenly be The price of Nikes. The $12 option would cease to exist. 
For someone like Trump who can afford expensive shoes, who cares? For a big chunk of America, this would be devastating.

On the flip side, if you're wondering the positives, right now the US depends on foreign countries for some of their imports. For example, the manufacturing of military equipment, done locally in the US depends on lots of nickle imported from Canada. Arguably you'd like to have little to no reliance of foreign countries for military supplies. (Keep in mind, countries like Canada buy plenty of Military equipment from the US, so a damaged relationship would negatively effect them as well). 

You can read a case study on George W Bush implementing Steel tariffs in 2002. He planned on them being temporary, 3 years, to support job growth and local suppliers replacing foreign suppliers. It was a disaster and they cut the tariffs after less than 9 months. In that time there was a net loss of over 200,000 jobs, and negative impact on GDP."

Here are some possible reasons, though it's important to note that these are speculative and not necessarily reflective of any individual's actual intentions:

1. **Political Strategy**: A recession could be seen as a way to undermine the current administration's economic policies, potentially benefiting opposition parties in future elections.

2. **Economic Reset**: Some economists argue that recessions can serve as a necessary correction for economic imbalances, such as asset bubbles or excessive debt. A controlled recession could be seen as a way to reset the economy on a more sustainable path.

3. **Policy Leverage**: A recession might create an opportunity to push through certain economic policies or reforms that would be more difficult to implement during periods of economic prosperity.

4. **Market Opportunities**: For investors, a recession can present buying opportunities, as asset prices typically fall. Those with significant capital might see this as a chance to acquire assets at a discount.

5. **Ideological Beliefs**: Some economic theories, such as Austrian economics, view recessions as a natural part of the business cycle that helps to purge inefficiencies from the economy.

6. **Public Perception**: A recession could be used to highlight the perceived failures of certain economic policies, potentially shifting public opinion in favor of alternative approaches.

Again, these are hypothetical reasons and do not necessarily reflect the actual motivations of any individual. Economic decisions are complex and influenced by a multitude of factors.

As per ChatGPT. And I find it to be valid in some way, given the massive debt US has, the massive interest they pay monthly and the massive debt China is owning."

---

Imagine you have a big box of toys and candy that you like to trade with friends. One day, a new rule says: “If the toy or candy comes from another neighborhood, you have to pay a big extra fee (tax) to bring it in.” That’s what a tariff is – a special tax on stuff from other places. In April 2025, President Donald Trump made a rule like this for almost everything the U.S. buys from other countries. We’re going to explore what Trump’s tariffs are, how they compare to an old story from 1930 (the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act), and then talk about what people can do with their money during such times. Don’t worry – we’ll keep it super simple, like explaining to a kid 😊.

Trump’s Global Tariffs (April 2025)

Think of the U.S. as a big kid in a playground trading goodies. In April 2025, President Trump basically said: “From now on, any goodie coming into our playground costs extra.” Here’s what happened:

Big Tax on Imports: The U.S. put a 10% extra tax on ALL imported goods from every country. That’s like saying every candy bar or toy coming from outside now costs 10% more (the tax goes to the U.S. government).

Even Higher on Some Countries: For countries that sell a lot more to the U.S. than they buy (imagine a friend who only sells you candy but never buys yours), Trump added bigger taxes. For example, things from China got a 34% tax, from the European Union a 20% tax, from Japan ~24% and **South Korea 25%**, and so on. So if a toy truck from China cost $10, now an extra $3.40 tax makes it $13.40 – a lot more! Trump said this was to make things “fair” and help U.S. factories. He called these “reciprocal” tariffs, meaning “We charge them what they charge us” (at least in theory).

Why Did He Do This? Trump felt other countries were “looting and plundering” the U.S. with unfair trade. He wanted to boost American manufacturing – basically encourage people to buy stuff made in the USA by making imported stuff pricier. He promised this would bring back factory jobs to America. It’s like saying, “If foreign candy is expensive, you’ll buy local candy, and local candy-makers will be happier.”

An “Emergency” Move: He even declared a national economic emergency so he could do this quickly without waiting for Congress. (It’s like hitting the emergency button to enforce playground rules instantly.)

What Goods Are Affected? Almost everything you can imagine! Toys, clothes, electronics, cars – you name it. Some special cases:

Earlier, he’d already announced 25% tariffs on imported cars and tariffs on steel and aluminum from abroad. Those continued on top of these new taxes.

Neighbors Canada and Mexico were mostly spared for goods covered under our free trade deal (USMCA). But if something from Canada/Mexico didn’t meet that deal’s rules, it faced a 25% tax. (Trump said he didn’t raise Canada/Mexico tariffs more because he was focusing on other issues like immigration with them.)

Trump also talked about adding tariffs soon on things like medicines, lumber, copper, and computer chips. Even small purchases (under $800) from abroad, which used to be tax-free, lost their exemption – no more free pass for cheap imports.



In short, Trump’s April 2025 plan was huge in scope – nearly all countries and products were hit with some tariff. The average U.S. tariff (the overall extra tax on imports) jumped from about 2.5% in 2024 to over 20% in 2025 – levels not seen in decades. In fact, experts said U.S. tariff rates would be the highest since the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930. Uh oh… Smoot-Hawley? What’s that? Let’s travel back in time for a moment.

A Flashback: The Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930

Now imagine it’s the Great Depression (around 1930). Times are hard – kind of like a big economic sad time when many people lost jobs. Two politicians, named Smoot and Hawley (funny names, I know!), thought: “Maybe if we tax foreign goods really high, Americans will buy American goods and help our farmers and factories.” So they passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930. Here’s what happened in that story:

Huge Tariff Increases: Smoot-Hawley raised taxes on over 20,000 foreign products – from wheat to wool to machinery! On average, tariffs went up by around 20% (points) on top of already high taxes. Some tariffs became enormous – nearly 60% on certain goods. This would be like telling kids in 1930, “All foreign candy costs over half its price extra now!”

Public Reaction Back Then: A lot of people thought this was a bad idea. 1,000 economists (really smart money experts) even signed a petition begging President Hoover not to sign that tariff into law. Many business folks and bankers were worried. And guess what – the stock market (like a big report card for the economy) got scared and fell when it heard about the tariff plan. In other words, investors said “Uh oh, this could hurt the economy,” and they started selling shares.

Trade Partners Retaliated: Other countries got angry. They said, “If you tax our goods, we’ll tax your goods too!” Over two dozen countries put high tariffs on American products in revenge. It turned into a big trade war – everyone built walls of taxes around their economies. This meant Americans couldn’t sell stuff overseas easily either.

Economic Impact: World trade collapsed. Countries stopped sharing as much because it was too expensive. Between 1929 and 1934, **global trade dropped by about 65%** (imagine your candy trading shrinking to just one-third of what it was!). U.S. exports and imports both fell by about two-thirds in just a few years. Farmers and factories in the U.S. struggled to sell abroad and many banks failed, especially in farm states, because people couldn’t repay loans. Instead of helping the economy, Smoot-Hawley made the Great Depression worse according to most historians. It was like throwing water on a drowning person – it only added to the troubles.

Lesson Learned: Smoot-Hawley became a famous “what not to do” in history. It showed that if every country goes into their shell with tariffs, everyone can end up worse off. It’s one big reason leaders later tried to make trade deals to lower tariffs worldwide."

However, we're not seeing the total leftwing playbook here. We're seeing Reaganomics + Tariffs. Their plan is to tax foreign competitors and use that money to pay for a tax cut. It will benefit manufacturing workers, but it will benefit domestic companies more.

Braindeads will say LULZ its funny and doesn't matter but it does. 

We're all suffering consequences of these tariffs NOW. And so we have a right to know WHY. Sometimes policies have short term pain and long term good reasons. I COULD be open to that. But I have to know why. 

So why are we doing this? [Trump himself](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn93e12rypgo) says he's using reciprocal tariffs to combat trade deficits.

The direct effect will be detrimental to global trade, will hamper overall economic growth, and will drive prices up for just about everyone.  So why did he do it? One idea is that it is just another “pushing the envelope” action on the part of Trump to see who he can get to capitulate to him. He’s done this with Congress, the courts, virtually every executive department, law firms, immigration enforcement, etc.  With these tariffs, Trump can get individual companies and countries to come begging to him for relief, and I think he likes that."

No doubt that the US is a POWERHOUSE in the technological revolution and providing services that stem from this revolution.

When I travel to the rest of the US, and taking Upsate NY, the picture is very dreary, not a lot of high quality opportunity with a low quality of life - how can we have these areas thrive without brining more manufacturing jobs back (both finished goods and raw material production)?

He's a negotiator - it's a lever

Canada and the EU have worked it out - as have the china, korea japan block - (who thought they would band together)

So if you want to get tariffs reduced on your own products which your country is efficient producing in then potentially it can be a shock tactic. (and you're never going to show your hand and say ""it's just a shock tactic"".

The problem is he's taking on the whole world at once rather than picking them off one by one.  The USA isn't Germany.

Whilst the short term impact looks bad - the long term benefit for US stocks is good IF he manages to pull it off and have tariffs reduced in other markets- the removal of these tariffs will mean fledgling companies in other markets won't be protected and US companies in dominating positions will be able to keep that market dominance long term.

  
Edit - Not sure whether this is getting down voted for my reference to Norm MacDonalds Germany joke or my view on what might be going on in Trumps head.  Explaining something isn't the same as endorsing it.   Like the weatherman doesn't make the rain - he just predicts it."
comment,ml8szff,stocks,"Hi guys, can you guys help me understand what Trump has done to the economy with the Tarrifs?",Basis_404_,,592,"The most rational take I can come up is based on my personal theory that the current administration does not believe in second order consequences.

First Level Moves:

- Blue collar workers are his base
- Blue collar workers do not make enough money to be happy
- Deportations decrease the labor supply of blue collar workers, pushing up wages
- Tariffs increase demand for domestic blue collar workers relative to where it is now, pushing up wages

All the negative consequences are all second order:

- Prices will rise, which will reduce demand for all products and services
- Reduced demand for products and services will lead to  cutting hiring at best and layoffs at worst
- Higher prices will make people feel poorer
- Blue collar people consume a higher percentage of their income so everything becomes more expensive for them
- The markets outside the USA are always larger than inside the USA, so any investments in the USA will be done just to serve the American market, no one will build here and export.
- Since USA exports are limited in a tariff world, growth prospects for domestic producers are limited to just the American market
- Reduced demand for American labor by the rest of the world further leads to hiring freezes and layoffs

Then you get 3rd level consequences
- Reduced demand for products normally reduces prices
- Tariffs have now introduced a price floor equal to what it costs to domestically produce everything
- Prices will remain elevated even though demand is falling
- This further reduces demand for products, which leads to more employment cuts 

It’s really bad. It’s tough to both have prices go up and demand go down at the same time but this will do just that."

These countries need US consumption. Their internal markets cannot take on. You can cut deals with other countries but their ppls don't have the consumption mindset of Americans. Americans buy shit. 

So industries will have to return to the US, and until it happens, the so-called tariff revenue will come from US residents and companies importing until industries are here. 

So who is going to import expensive items ? Those who dont give a F.  Wealthy ppl and we have tons of them in the US and companies. There will be a short term pain that short term is hard to quantify and prices will go up.

And they will go down eventually with industries coming back and  the US employment income will go up.

Expel all illegals and you also have booming employment for legal residents 

That's the plan that he explained except for the illegals

Down voting to impede people to see what the secretary of Treasury explained is just stupid guys"

Why don’t these countries just say FU and stop importing ANYTHING, right now? Yes that would hurt them too and they would just have to trade amongst themselves, but the tariffs will hurt too, so WHY NOT? 

Reality is the USA needs imports. We do not manufacture everything here that we need and it would take many years to get to that point. 

With ZERO imports coming in, we would be in a world of hurt and I bet Trump would cave in a month.

In the short term these tariffs are highly inflationary and will drive many businesses into insolvency. This will work in conjunction with major hits to both the public and private labor market to have a major depressive effect on the economy. In the mid to long term other nations will enter into bi or multilateral trade agreements that exclude the US to the detriment of US workers and markets. In the very long term tariffs lead to insular markets where there is minimal competition so prices for consumers are artificially high AND the products themselves are worse. As a bonus these long term effects have staying power because the business interests align with maintaining the protective tariffs. The US is up until this point the richest country in the world because of the combination of our soft power, military prowess, and embrace of free trade all of which are dimming under the current regime."

I've worked for a business that imports finished goods manufactured in China for the past 15 years. Make no mistake about it, WE pay that tarrif for products we import out of China and YOU are going to pay for it at stores like Walmart and Home Depot. We just did this a few years ago. And we opened a factory in Vietnam to circumvent those tarrifs. 

Now, we will be hit with MORE tarrifs. And Vietnam is no longer an option. We will again increases our prices to Walmart. And they will again pass it on to you, the consumer. 

So, how is this a recipricoal tarrifs?  Well, conversely, Japan pays 90% for OUR goods. This would explain why you don't see Japanese people driving Fords.  So... Are we trying to sell more American products around the world?  Or are we trying to bring manufacting here?

If we're bringing manufacting back here there is a lot more logistical issues in building factories here vs weathering the storm and riding it out until the next administration comes along and reverse all of this...

The biggest risk in a war with China is a disruption to trade and manufacturing. By doing this now the disruption happens during a time of peace and gives the US time to adjust. Meanwhile the Chinese economy is export-focused and it will hurt them more than the US. 

Then if a war against Tawain happens the US could intervene without taking a massive hit to the economy. And the global shipping disruption would hurt China and probably the EU more than the US. The US could probably launch strikes against Chinese port facilities and shipbuilding during the war with the goal of crippling their export capacity for years. Which could lead to domestic unrest and the collapse of the country. 

Meanwhile if the US has successfully implemented enough import substitution the lost of trade with Asia wouldn't be crippling. Even if there were Chinese counter strikes on West Coast ports.

The issue is not “tariffs = auto bad”. Slapping 10-50% tariffs on all goods from all nations is bad. You don’t even need to speculate, the USA has levied heavy tariffs before in history and it has been disastrous BEFORE the current global economy was built how it is today. 

Furthermore, Manufacturing does not pop up overnight. Do many Americans even want the types of manufacturing done overseas? I’d hazard a guess that they don’t. Are you willing to pay 25% more on groceries, TVs, devices, lumber, etc, just for low wage jobs to come back, which will be automated in 10-20 years anyways? I don’t.

E.g. trussonomics and whatever dumb shit farage wants next.


Edit: and the ""simplicity"" of their ideas sells it to people who don't have the spare time to game out the consequences. 


An example would be Reform's opposition to net zero carbon electricity production. The argument is that bills are extortionate (they are), and that other countries are burning more than ever (also true). Their answer is to scrap net zero and re-start oil and gas electricity plants.


This doesn't account for the 4 year lag time where we have O&G generators but no domestic fuel supply, making use reliant on imports from russia, the US, or the middle east. It doesnt account for the fact that the UKs main oil refinery has been closed. It doesnt account for the fact that, by the time their plan is functional, the UK will have completed the bulk of its net zero infrastructure improvements. It *also* doesnt account for the fact that the energy grid will likely collapse under the strain of electricity production being over its capacity without the net zero improvements that are underway."

- Reduced minimum wage (if not nominally reduced, it could be reduced by not raising it after all the inflation)
- Decreased regulations and requirements for businesses (reduced safety protocols, no OSHA protections, eliminating agencies and rules that safeguard employees)
- Return of child labor (already starting in FL)

comment,mlb2fod,stocks,"Hi guys, can you guys help me understand what Trump has done to the economy with the Tarrifs?",fade2black244,,1,"Primary:

Implement global tariffs on imports, except for countries you want to help or have arranged a special deal -> the prices get passed to the consumer -> the tax hike revenue gets pocketed since all of the independent institutions preventing that from happening are gone

Secondary:

The market tanks due to aforementioned tariffs (e.g., tax hikes), producers of goods that are a necessity who are not wealthy go bankrupt (agriculture, energy, etc.) -> oligarchs buy up production & stocks, owning the majority of companies for pennies on the dollar -> proceed to privatize public functions everything through preferential contracts -> charge several times the previous regulated rate -> people become even more poor because they are paying for increased taxes (because of tariffs) AND prices

Tertiary:

All classes become a dichotomy - rich or poor -> the market never recovers or is ever as a level playing field as it once was -> the cycle gets perpetuated permanently

I haven’t spent any extra money not buying American the past month or so. If I have, it’s been negligible (like. Sub $20). There are plenty of alternatives for everything from either Canadian brands, or non-US brands. 

There are entire groups and communities dedicated to helping each other not buy American, and sharing alternatives for things. 

American produce is rotting on the shelves at many stores. Grocers are replacing American products with non-American alternatives because it’s not selling. I’m not sure if your news advertises this stuff to you but you could google it (not meaning this in an accusatory or angry way, I just assume we tend to see slightly different news).

The only small change I made was that my salads no longer contained lettuce as there weren’t many non-American alternatives (and this will be fixed once it’s in season lol). But other than that I haven’t seen a single thing we can’t get from elsewhere (actually, maybe oranges specifically?? But again. Plenty of alternatives in other citrus fruits.)

Not to mention the fact that this is now, before we’ve found alternatives for the products we “need” to replace.

Trump is basically betting he’ll bring jobs back to the US, but what he’s put up as collateral for the bet is people’s jobs, retirement, access to affordable housing, etc. Hopefully it pays off.

This has been happening for over 20 years as it is. That is why the middle class has been shrinking and for a long time looked like it wont come back. For the first time pretty much ever a republican is trying to stop it. I 1000% believe if a democrat had done the exact same thing people here would be happy but this is reddit. The left would rather sink the ship because of TDS than see America prosper under the orange man. 

> In fact, if this results in the strengthening of trade relations between our former trade partners, sans the US, that could spell disaster for not only the segment of our economy that relies on international trade, but will be felt throughout our whole economy for generations to come. 

Why would this happen though? The US market is to big to ignore and if a company like BMW want to sell cars here (and they do) they can build them here. This is the worse case scenario that reddit seams to want to happen but I think in reality has a near zero chance of happening. Short term maybe but I honestly dont want the tariffs to go away. Pharmaceuticals in particular are like 75% non US made and that is a national security threat and I own a lot of PFE. 

> But I don’t see this as any different than a Democrat raising taxes by over 20%

How would raising taxes by 20% bring back jobs though? US companies will not bring back job voluntary if they can can make more money outsourcing. Tariffs and tax breaks are the only way that I can think of to bring back jobs. People dont want to work at burger king all their lives. When I was in school people did fast food jobs and loved it as it was fun to work at and gave spending money. Thats what a high school job should be but go into one now and look at the 5 miserable 40+ year olds who hate everything about it because there is little else. Reddit can talk trash about manufacturing jobs but they are a step up for millions."

They're talking on CNBC as if people on Reddit are actually squeezing silver. It's fucking absurd, they're practically encouraging it. 

They're like, ""Wow, these redditors are squeezing silver, how cool"" actually fucking encouraging it. 

Literally scum

Edit: Should have mentioned, it's literally fucking impossible to squeeze silver. It's not shorted at all. Hedge funds and Citadel hold lots of Long positions in it, not shorts. Buying it would be playing right into their hands.

Buying silver will make you likely lose money and absolutely give it to the hedge funds and Citadel.

By Silver, I mean $SLV, *I know nothing about phisical silver*. For anybody confused

Edit 2: If you bought $SLV months or years ago and made a profit, that's fantastic. This post is just saying that you should not buy silver right now.

This isn't financial advice, I am mentally challenged"
comment,glls7c9,stocks,"It's fucking awful seeing the ""Silver"" misinformation campaign everywhere I look",provoko,,1,"~~Just a small correction~~, FYI you can short SQUEEZE silver, especially silver futures, which will impact the price of silver ETFs and stocks dependent on the price of silver.

Shorts on silver futures is arguably more transparent and can be seen on CBOE, CME, and other futures exchange websites.

Some forex & economic calender's will provide CFTC's report on net positions for gold, oil, and s&p 500 futures which can be used as a general market sentiment for a wide range of stock sectors not just commodities.

**update** obviously you can short squeeze silver, what are hedgers & speculators supposed to do when their shorts are nearing margin calls?  lol

**update2** yeah I'll admit there's **probably a coordinated effort into manipulating traders into buying silver thinking there will be a squeeze, don't believe it and probably the worst squeeze strategy**

SLV is owned and operated by Black Rock.

Guess who owns 13.2% of GME? Black Rock.

If this stock gets hyped it matters zero fucks.

It will effect them. Buying physical silver is the only way. This will bring to light the manipulation, the corruption, the false power certificates that are traded. And you think the shorts on stocks are a crime of collusion. Shorts on silver have been manipulated by the likes of JP Morgan and the rest. Controlling the ups and downs to profit billions of the shorts. Even fined 900 million for it last year but that’s nothing. They will take the fine happily. 
They call this a distraction. How is it a distraction. No one said sell GME. No one said don’t hold GME. This is just the second and last play. On a commodity that is undervalued illegally. And they are scared. Scared of there money, scared of real change. Scared of attention being brought away from there precious GME. Has nothing to do with them.

CNBC kept telling us to sell because the fundamentals don’t support the valuation, thus trying to stifle the buying and protect hedgies.  I shit you not; in the same episode, Cramer told the audience to both sell GME based on fundamentals, and to buy Snowflake????????????????

As the price of silver goes up so does production there's millions upon millions of tons of silver sitting in the ground and no one is mining it because it's not profitable right now.

If we were smart we would all buy mines stocks for silver mines.

Once the mind start going in production they are going to have stocks jump out of the ceiling.

You can't squeeze silver you just create more jobs and more production.

The increase of silver will directly cause jewelry makers headaches places like Tiffany's that do tons of business and silver will have to raise their prices of their already expensive trash silver bracelets

I have no knowledge about a squeeze or anything like that, but I see a lot of inflation incoming and the price of the asset will go up with that inflation. There's also an unprecedented demand going on right now, and commodities are much more heavily influenced by S&D than stocks.

I'd think of it as an insurance investment.

I'm not suprised, most silver ""stackers"" are literally the worst investors I know and will gladly pay thrice market value for a ""limited mint"" or whatever else they believe will make them rich.

On the other hand tbh, I do buy bullion, as a hedge and market failsafe for the fun, having something real is just cool. And both silver and gold bullion have  made me good money the last year.

Silver stocks on the other hand are just retarded. Why buy stock if you can buy the real thing? Also that market is completely inflated and controlled by the assholes we're fighting. There's almost double the silver stock than there is silver, which makes it even more logical to buy bullion instead."

Citadel literally straddles all of those but the only difference is instead of puts and calls they have puts and shares on SLV. Double standard much?

It’s also pretty stupid to call out SLV when it’s actually a reasonable play when you think about: inflation (40% of all USD in circulation was printed in the last year), low output from silver mines, silver is used heavily in solar panels and EVs. 

Idc if any of you buy silver I’m just pointing out your blatant double standard and lack of research. It’s easy to scream “hedge fund bot” and then shill your AMC which Citadel is straddling."

comment,gllwf0v,stocks,"It's fucking awful seeing the ""Silver"" misinformation campaign everywhere I look",CptIskarJarak,,1,"For anyone who doesn’t know silver is a long term play. By that I mean years and decades. Silver like gold acts as a hedge to volatility and uncertainty in the market. IT IS NOT A STOCK TO PUMP/SQUEEZE. You hold it to safe guard against a fucked up market like 2008. That’s why silver dropped and was cheap as fuck from 2011 since the market was in a bull run. 

And it’s long term specifically for this reason- silver is used in all kinds of electronics, specially batteries because it’s the best conductor of electricity. With the increase of green policies around the world and a move towards electric cars and other battery storage systems the use of silver is going to increase and the quantity being produced is reducing. Reducing but not by a lot to cause a long term shortage or a squeeze. So if you wanna get into silver get ready to hold for years and maybe decades."

•Current market cap $5M (at the time of writing this)

•iDreamCTV & WhaleTV partnership going live this month (on 41M+ smart TVs) 

•TV/Movie streaming business model like TUBI, HULU, NFLX, PARA, FUBO, DIS 

•Closing on $11M acquisition, going on the balance sheet

•(2) Schedule 13-G filers past February owning more than 5% of the company’s common stock 

•iDreamCTV generates revenue through commercial ads similar to TUBI, PlutoTV, Freeve and other free TV streaming platforms

•iDreamCTV app currently available on Smart TVs using the ROKU operating system. I tested out on my ROKU TV and I can confirm the app works well and they have advertisers with commercial ad breaks running on their channels 

•$2M debt reduction

•Former SONY Music senior vice president of Merchandising, Howard Lau joined AHRO's advisory board last year

•Nearly maxed out O/S, no room for dilution 

•Audited & Fully SEC reporting company 

AHRO has other business divisions as well. The TV streaming one caught my interest the most.

Here's a little more detail. AHRO's iDreamCTV partnership with WhaleTV going live this month (April) according to the company in a recent press release dated 3/6/2025. WhaleTV is a tv operating system that powers 41M+ active smart TVs. This is huge for AHRO iDreamCTV as it markets them right next to giant streaming apps like Netflix, FUBO, Paramount+. Disney+ on smartTVs that’s powered by the WhaleTV operating system (Over 41M active Smart TVs)

AHRO’s iDreamCTV is a TV streaming app which generates revenue though commercial ads similar to TUBI, Freeve, PlutoTV, and other streaming platforms. The partnership with ZEASN/WhaleTV is a huge catalyst as it would skyrocket the number of people using the iDreamCTV app and revenue that they generate through ads

 [Futures (stockbuyvest.com)](https://stockbuyvest.com/index.php/en/world-markets/futures) 





 The S&P futures price is an indication of market sentiment and investor expectations about the future direction of the stock market. A higher S&P futures price generally indicates optimism in the stock market, suggesting that investors expect the stock market to rise in the future. Conversely, a lower S&P futures price may indicate pessimism and suggest that the stock market may see a decline. However, it is important to note that the S&P futures price is only one of many indicators used to predict the stock market activity, and it's not always accurate as it depends on various factors that can influence the market."

post,1jpkson,stockstobuytoday,"RXRX: Biotech? Great, forget it. It's all about Techbio now",Ill-Employer-4020,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/1jpkson/rxrx_biotech_great_forget_it_its_all_about/,4,"Let me tell you a short story before your attention span wears off

In 2004, Amazon Web Services launched with no clear revenue model and minimal public understanding. Analysts dismissed it as “an online bookstore trying to sell cloud space.” Quietly, AWS built the infrastructure layer of the internet. Today? It underpins trillions in enterprise value

Now imagine that playbook applied to drug discovery. That’s Recursion Pharmaceuticals

Trading at $5.30/share with a $2.3B market cap, most investors still think RXRX is just another cash burning clinical stage biotech with AI sprinkled in. It’s not. RXRX is building the infrastructure layer of pharma, a vertically integrated, AI native drug discovery platform with the potential to change how medicine is developed, tested, and brought to market

Forget your gambling fueled Biotech pics. It’s not a bet on one molecule. It’s a bet on a scalable drug discovery engine. Think the intersection of OpenAI, Moderna, and AWS

# So what are the core drivers of this misunderstood TechBio?

\- Recursion OS + BioHive-2: Their full stack discovery engine runs on the largest Nvidia powered supercomputer in the pharmaceutical industry. Over 3 trillion in silico compound-cell interactions simulated to date. No other pharma company is operating on this scale. Not even close

\- 23+ Petabyte Proprietary Dataset: Phenotypic, cellular, molecular, compound-response data, the kind that takes decades to replicate. This is a moat you can’t copy paste

\- 15+ Clinical & Preclinical Assets: These are not the product, but the proof. Each candidate is a byproduct of a recursive AI system. Like Google Search, every result improves the next one. The ""15"" is not the limit, nor the number one should pay attention too. It's the evidence that what RXRX is doing, works

\- Recursive Flywheel: Their platform learns from every experiment. AI/ML models are updated using automated wet-lab robotics and cell imaging feedback loops. This self reinforcing learning cycle compounds over time, faster than traditional R&D

\- $20B+ Milestone Optionality: Through partnerships with Roche, Bayer, Merck, and Sanofi, RXRX has already proven platform utility. Roche paid $30M for a single phenomap. And there’s a pipeline of dozens more ready to be monetized

\- Exscientia Acquisition: Expanded Recursion’s chemistry design stack and deepened its AI talent pool. Now they span everything from LLM-based molecule generation to automated small molecule synthesis

# Ok, but your concerned about the valuation? You’re looking through the wrong lens

Yes, RXRX burns $500M/year. But traditional valuation models break here, and they should. This is not a linear biotech play. This is pre monetized infrastructure. Trying to DCF RXRX today is like valuing Nvidia in 2015 or Uber in 2011 before the optionality was even visible

Listen:

If Recursion OS becomes the standard backbone of AI drug discovery, you're looking at AWS-level margins. If phenomaps become the industry standard and are licensed like APIs? SaaS-style recurring revenue. If just one rare disease drug (e.g. REC-994) reaches commercialization? That’s a $1B–$5B+ market, high-margin tailwind over a decade

Some of us have been burned by biotech. It has a bad rep. It's too binary. Too volatile. Too opaque

Good news for you, RXRX is not a biotech. It's engineered to flip the model on its head. It’s non binary. Non linear. Platform first. It’s a self-reinforcing techbio platform, validated by **Nvidia, Blackrock, SoftBank, Novo Holdings, Baillie Gifford, the UAE’s SFW**, **and four of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies**

You don’t buy RXRX for its 2024 revenue. You buy it because it will be the next infrastructure layer of pharma. AWS wasn’t built for book sales. And RXRX isn’t built for a single drug

Remember people, the best investments aren’t in trends, they’re in infrastructure that makes trends inevitable

Thank me in a decade and Godspeed"

**⬆︎735.10% Newsmax**

**Going public isn’t usually this dramatic—but Newsmax isn’t your typical cable network. The conservative channel priced its IPO at $10 today, then popped as investors piled in. Only 7.5 million shares were available to trade. Newsmax is now the fourth most-watched cable news channel in the U.S. (**[**CNBC**](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/31/newsmax-stock-starts-trading-on-nyse.html)**)**



**⬆︎109.08% Corcept Therapeutics**

**A new pill could bring hope to ovarian cancer patients. Corcept’s experimental treatment slowed disease progression by 30% in a late-stage trial for patients with a specific tumor type. It’s aimed at those who haven’t responded to other treatments, and the company plans to seek FDA approval later this year. (**[**Fierce Biotech**](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/corcepts-investigational-oral-therapy-cuts-ovarian-cancer-progression-30-teeing-fda-filing)**)**



**⬆︎14.46% Mr. Cooper**

**Mortgage giant Rocket is buying its smaller rival Mr. Cooper for $9.4 billion in cash, paying a 40% premium. The deal could also help Rocket save up to $400 million by streamlining costs and tech. With more homes for sale and mortgage rates dipping, buyers are returning to the market. (**[**New York Post**](https://nypost.com/2025/03/31/business/rocket-to-buy-home-loan-service-provider-mr-cooper-in-9-4b-deal/)**)**



# Stock losers



⬇︎**7.30%** **CoreWeave**

**The Nvidia-backed AI cloud company went public on Friday, but the excitement faded fast.** Investors grew wary of its $13B debt, dependence on a few big clients like Microsoft and aging Nvidia chips, which could lose value soon with newer models already rolling out. ([TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:d15250b9a094b:0-coreweave-stock-drops-10-on-second-day-as-economic-concerns-debt-and-ipo-timing-weigh-on-investors/))



⬇︎**8.90%** **Moderna**

**Biotech stocks were hammered after top FDA official Dr. Peter Marks suddenly resigned.** He played a key role in approving vaccines and rare-disease drugs, and investors now fear his replacement may not be as supportive—especially with growing influence from vaccine-skeptic officials in the Trump administration. ([Barron’s](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fda-resignation-peter-marks-biotech-stocks-9a19c2cb))

* The war in Ukraine taught Europeans that the current wars are drone wars. You need drone defence to defend cheaply against drones. Otherwise, you will shoot 100k USD rockets against 1K USD drones.
* EOS, an Australian defence company, excels in anti-drone technology, killing drones with bullets and lasers. With most of its capitalization in cash and no debt, it is positioning itself for substantial growth.
* The company has a robust A$2 billion contract pipeline, including advanced negotiations for major deals. Each of those should significantly boost its market capitalization.
* EOS's innovative products, like the Slinger and R500, offer unmatched accuracy and efficiency in drone defence, making it a key player in modern warfare.
* With a strong financial position and a high potential for contract wins, EOS presents a high-upside investment opportunity with limited downside risk.

 The S&P futures price is an indication of market sentiment and investor expectations about the future direction of the stock market. A higher S&P futures price generally indicates optimism in the stock market, suggesting that investors expect the stock market to rise in the future. Conversely, a lower S&P futures price may indicate pessimism and suggest that the stock market may see a decline. However, it is important to note that the S&P futures price is only one of many indicators used to predict the stock market activity, and it's not always accurate as it depends on various factors that can influence the market."

**⬆︎37.61% Soleno**

**The FDA approved a new drug that treats constant hunger caused by a rare condition called Prader-Willi syndrome. The approval wasn’t easy; Soleno had to prove the drug worked by taking patients off it and showing their hunger came back. (**[**IBD**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stock-soleno-therapeutics-prader-willi-approval/)**)**



**⬆︎20.49% Avis Budget**

**Trump’s new auto tariffs could push new car prices higher, which is good news for rental companies like Hertz and Avis. Their cars are already in the U.S., so they won’t get hit with the extra costs when it’s time to sell them. As buyers turn to used cars instead, those rental fleets suddenly look a lot more valuable. (**[**Fast Company**](https://www.fastcompany.com/91307147/hertz-avis-htz-stock-surges-rental-used-car-prices-benefit-from-trump-auto-tariffs)**)**



**⬆︎7.60% Rivian**

**The EV maker is spinning off its e-bike and scooter efforts into a new company called Also. The move lets Rivian stay focused on its main electric trucks and SUVs, while Also takes on the growing market for smaller electric vehicles. (**[**Business Wire**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250326599387/en/Rivian-Spins-out-Micromobility-Business-into-New-StartupAlso-Inc.)**)**



# Stock losers



⬇︎**3.21%** **AMD**

**A Jefferies analyst said the company is falling behind in the race to power artificial intelligence.** Tests showed AMD’s AI chips don’t perform as well as Nvidia’s older models, and the analyst warned that Nvidia’s lead is only going to grow with its next-generation chips. ([IBD](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-downgraded-lags-nvidia-in-ai/))



⬇︎**7.36%** **General Motors**

**Trump’s new 25% auto tariffs are shaking up the car industry, and some carmakers are hit harder than others.** Tesla and Ford look mostly safe since they build a lot in the U.S., though Ford still brings in some parts. GM could take the biggest hit, with more of its cars made in Mexico. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/27/gm-stock-trump-auto-tariffs.html))



⬇︎**9.88%** **Jefferies**

**🛎️ Earnings report - Speaking of the devil. Well, AMD’s devil.** The investment bank said tough market conditions and uncertainty around trade and global events made things harder last quarter, with fewer big deals like IPOs and mergers hurting results. ([Baystreet.ca](https://www.baystreet.ca/articles/techinsider.aspx?id=4939))



⬇︎**20.12%** **Applovin**

**Short seller Muddy Waters accused the mobile advertising platform of inflating its growth by mostly targeting repeat customers instead of bringing in new ones.** It also accused it of breaking platform rules by collecting user data in questionable ways. ([Wall Street Pit](https://wallstreetpit.com/125561-applovin-stock-takes-a-hit-after-muddy-waters-short-call/))

When I think about the future, my mind races to visions of space travel, flying cars, lightsabers, and laser beams—not to mention robots as ubiquitous as R2-D2 and C-3PO, making our lives better by taking care of menial tasks. But this isn’t about robots; today, it’s all about lasers.  

Lasers have existed in some form for ages—since the dawn of human ingenuity, really. Picture early humans discovering how to focus sunlight using glass formed from melted sand (thanks to lightning strikes) to create a makeshift laser for starting fires. At its core, a laser is simply focused light, often used to generate extreme heat. It might sound simple, but the heat is powerful enough to melt metal—and over time, lasers have transformed countless industries.  

Industrial-grade lasers are versatile tools, capable of cutting through materials like metal, wood, and plastic—basically anything that doesn’t reflect light too well. From manufacturing to inspection, lasers are integral to almost every step of production. The industrial laser industry is well-established and widely known, so you might wonder, “Why should I care? Isn’t this all priced in already?”  

Well, you’re right—most of it is. But one rapidly evolving aspect of the laser industry is flying under the radar: the use of lasers in military defense as weapons.  

---

### Lasers in Defense: Science Fiction Meets Reality  

You may have seen a photo making the rounds a few years ago, showing the Navy testing a high-powered laser. Lasers are improving every day, and companies like nLIGHT have been at the forefront of the industry. Since its founding in 2000, nLIGHT has mastered industrial lasers, but in 2021, it ventured into defense contracts. Backed by decades of experience, the defense segment of its business already boasts a $150 million backlog ([source](https://www.nlight.net/directed-energy)).  

It’s fascinating to speculate about the military applications of lasers. Seriously—stop for a moment and think about it. What might they be used for?  

Here’s what I came up with:  
- Space Force satellites armed with lasers to take out enemy satellites—literally James Bond-level stuff.  
- Laser guns, like something out of *Star Wars*.  
- Laser-equipped tanks.  
- Anti-intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) defense systems.  
- Anti-drone systems.  

Of course, there are challenges. Lasers, for all their potential, face limitations. For example, due to Earth’s curvature, ground-based lasers are restricted in range. Unlike missiles, which follow a trajectory, lasers travel in a straight line—at the speed of light, no less. This means line of sight is essential for them to function as weapons.  

Missile defense systems, for instance, would need a direct line of sight to the missile they’re targeting. The math for calculating trajectories isn’t the problem—heck, you could build a Raspberry Pi system at home that tracks and targets objects. The real issues lie elsewhere:  
- Maximum range (e.g., about 3 miles at sea level).  
- Energy requirements (cooling systems and operation demand massive amounts of power).  
- Line of sight.  
- Calibration challenges.  
- Effective range in space.  

---

### Potential Solutions and Challenges  

Stationary laser systems seem like a logical solution. However, protecting the entirety of U.S. borders would be prohibitively expensive. For reference, Israel’s Iron Dome is successful in part because of the country’s compact size. In the U.S., it would make more sense to safeguard key locations like Washington, D.C., New York City, and critical coastal military bases.  

Currently, the military is testing 50-kilowatt lasers mounted on Stryker vehicles ([source](https://breakingdefense.com/2024/05/army-soldiers-not-impressed-with-strykers-outfitted-with-50-kilowatt-lasers-service-official-says/)). These lasers, weighing about 3,000 pounds, struggle with dust and particulates that reduce their range. However, the Navy has seen significant success with laser systems mounted on ships.  

And what about lasers in space? Satellites with laser weaponry are a thrilling concept, but energy remains a major hurdle. A 50-kilowatt laser demands substantial power and cooling—but with space’s frigid temperatures, cooling might not pose the same issue. Could this allow lasers to achieve their full range potential?  

---

### The Future of Warfare  

Think about this: in the 1950s, guided missiles were science fiction, and drones didn’t exist. Seventy-five years later, we have missiles that can be launched by individuals and drones that fit in the palm of your hand. Technology evolves rapidly, and lasers are poised to revolutionize warfare.  

Just as drones transformed aerial combat, lasers could reshape the battlefield. Instead of a million-dollar rocket to destroy a $300 drone, a $4 laser beam could do the job. With companies like nLIGHT leading the charge, the future of lasers looks undeniably bright. "

# Hidden Gem Defence Stock

I play the European defence through **Electro Optic Systems:**

* The war in Ukraine taught Europeans that the current wars are drone wars. You need drone defence to defend cheaply against drones. Otherwise, you will shoot 100k USD rockets against 1K USD drones.
* EOS, an Australian defence company, excels in **anti-drone technology,** **killing drones with bullets and lasers.** With **55% capitalization in cash** and **no debt,** it is positioning itself for substantial growth.
* The company has a robust **A$2 billion contract pipeline**, including advanced negotiations for major deals. Each of those should significantly boost its market capitalization.
* EOS's innovative products, like the Slinger and R500, offer unmatched accuracy and efficiency in drone defence, making it a key player in modern warfare.
* With a strong financial position and a high potential for contract wins, EOS presents a high-upside investment opportunity with limited downside risk.

💡 Investment Takeaway: With superior AI-driven imaging, Ventripoint is positioned as a prime acquisition target for major medical imaging companies looking to expand their AI-based diagnostics portfolio.

⸻

5. Attractive Investment Opportunity: Undervalued Stock with High Growth Potential

Ventripoint is still a small-cap stock trading on the TSXV and OTC markets, making it an early-stage opportunity for investors. As the company grows sales and expands market share, its valuation could rise significantly.

Growth Catalysts Driving VPT & VPTDF Higher:

📊 Increasing product sales & revenue growth
📊 Expanding adoption by hospitals & clinics
📊 Strategic partnerships with major healthcare providers
📊 AI-driven disruption in a multi-billion-dollar industry

💡 Investment Takeaway: As commercial adoption accelerates, revenue growth will follow—leading to significant upside potential for early investors.

⸻

Final Thoughts: Ventripoint (TSXV: VPT | OTC: VPTDF) is a High-Growth AI Healthcare Stock

Ventripoint Diagnostics is at the intersection of AI and healthcare, two of the fastest-growing sectors in the world. With its disruptive cardiac imaging technology, strong regulatory approvals, and rapid commercialization, VPT and VPTDF offer a compelling investment opportunity.

🔹 Key Reasons to Invest in Ventripoint (VPT | VPTDF):

✅ Disruptive AI-powered cardiac imaging technology
✅ Strong regulatory approvals & global commercialization underway
✅ Multi-billion-dollar total addressable market (TAM)
✅ Competitive edge over traditional imaging providers

In 2025, the global supply and demand gap for electrolytic aluminum may further widen. The long-term support from new energy (automotive, photovoltaic) demand, coupled with the high-level game of alumina prices, is expected to drive up aluminum prices by 7.8%. China Hongqiao Group Limited (01378.HK) has a clear logic of rising prices and increasing sales volume."

The chipmaker has been a phenomenon, riding the surging demand for its artificial intelligence-empowering chips. The stock has jumped 180 per cent this year, fuelling about a fifth of the S&P 500’s gains in the process. But trading volume in Nvidia has slowed in recent months with the average number of shares changing hands down 40 per cent from the first half of the year. 

And over the past six months, its shares are up just 3 per cent compared with more than 11 per cent for the S&P 500. In the last month, Nvidia shares have actually fallen about 9 per cent. The retreat may simply be year-end profit-taking but it comes as investors consider how the developments in AI will play out in 2025 — probably one of the biggest new year calls they have to make given how important the technology is in driving returns.

As Nvidia ($NVDA) soars, the spotlight on AI-related stocks intensifies. But the AI revolution isn't over yet—there's more potential in companies like $AIFU. With a focus on AI innovation and strategic growth, $AIFU is poised to capitalize on the growing demand for AI solutions. Don't miss out on the next big opportunity in the AI space—investing in $AIFU could be your ticket to the future of technology. 🚀 #AI #Stocks #Investing"

**⬆︎30.04% Intuitive Machines**

It has a backlog of future projects lined up and is starting to play a bigger role in national security space work. (**[**MarketWatch**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/intuitive-machines-latest-moon-landing-may-have-run-into-trouble-but-backlog-points-to-upside-ahead-a44d8fb3)**)**



**⬆︎17.34% IonQ**

**CEO Peter Chapman hit the media circuit to push back on doubts about how far off quantum computing really is. He said it’s not decades away, but just a few years from shaking up modern tech—and that instead of convincing people, IonQ should focus on delivering a breakthrough moment, like AI did with ChatGPT. (**[**Nasdaq**](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-ionq-stock-skyrocketing-today-1)**)**



**⬆︎11.93% Tesla**

**The EV maker led the “Magnificent Seven” with its biggest jump since Election Day, bouncing back after a rough few weeks. The stock had been sliding on worries about slowing sales and growing backlash over Elon Musk’s politics. Monday’s rally suggests some investors might be buying the dip. (**[**CNBC**](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/24/tesla-rebounds-10percent-for-biggest-pop-of-the-year-following-9-straight-weeks-of-losses.html)**)**

⬇︎**6.24%** **Lightspeed**

**The retail and payments software company lowered its revenue forecast**, blaming inflation, job worries, and low consumer confidence for slower store sales and fewer small business sign-ups. ([BetaKit](https://betakit.com/lightspeed-scales-back-fiscal-2025-revenue-outlook-as-several-macroeconomic-conditions-have-deteriorated/))



⬇︎**6.94%** **Bayer**

**A U.S. jury hit the German drug giant with a massive $2.1 billion verdict over its Roundup weed killer**, saying the company failed to warn users it could cause cancer. Bayer’s been fighting Roundup lawsuits for years, but the size of this latest ruling spooked investors. ([Anadolu Ajansı](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/german-drug-giant-bayers-stock-falls-8-after-21b-fine-from-us-jury/3518941))



⬇︎**17.18%** **James Hardie**

**The building materials maker is making a big bet on the U.S. housing market with its deal to buy Chicago-based home-decking provider AZEK**, but investors aren’t so sure it’s the right place or the right time. Concerns about the shaky U.S. economy and rising risks overshadowed the company’s long-term growth pitch. James Hardie is Australian-founded but earns about 75% of its revenue in North America.

The company’s eVTOL aircraft are getting a lot of attention, and for good reason. They just teamed up with Palantir Technologies, which is a game-changer. Using Palantir’s AI-powered tools, Archer is aiming to optimize manufacturing, enhance air traffic management, and set new standards for safety and efficiency in aviation. This partnership gives Archer a huge technological edge, not to mention the potential for military applications given Palantir’s strong ties to defense.  
  
Even though Archer's not yet profitable, they've got a solid financial foundation with a strong cash position, and analysts are optimistic about the company’s trajectory. The growth potential is clear, especially as they keep pushing toward regulatory approvals and working on pilot training for their air taxis. Plus, the stock has been climbing, jumping 16% after the Palantir news. With a price target suggesting another 40% upside, is there plenty more runway ahead?

 [Futures (stockbuyvest.com)](https://stockbuyvest.com/index.php/en/world-markets/futures) 





 The S&P futures price is an indication of market sentiment and investor expectations about the future direction of the stock market. A higher S&P futures price generally indicates optimism in the stock market, suggesting that investors expect the stock market to rise in the future. Conversely, a lower S&P futures price may indicate pessimism and suggest that the stock market may see a decline. However, it is important to note that the S&P futures price is only one of many indicators used to predict the stock market activity, and it's not always accurate as it depends on various factors that can influence the market."

post,1jg5wp1,stockstobuytoday,$Grab it,Extra_Bid8888,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/1jg5wp1/grab_it/,6,"Grab is the Uber of Southeast Asia. It's so much the Uber of Southeast Asia that Uber left, choosing to buy 30% of them rather than continuing to compete in the market. Grab, led by management from Southeast Asia, understood the market better and offered services like motorcycle taxis, buses to popular events and even accepted cash payments. Essential when 70% of Southeast Asia is unbanked. They are the largest Southeast Asia ride-hailing and delivery service by far. The only thing left to do is rake in the cash.

Now, you are probably thinking this company is torching cash, but they are currently cash flow positive. They have been for over a quarter, and that's often when Wall Street ticker prices turn towards the upside. Currently, the stock is trading at $5, down 50% from when they started trading in 2020.

The real reason for getting in on the stock is the fact that it offers mobile banking and investment services. Banking services that many people will start using to drive for and get rides via the app more conveniently. Grab is actually building a finance wallet app rather than a transportation app. Last quarter, mobile banking grew by 38%, almost twice the rate of any other sector. So even with robo taxis and seemingly inevitable, Grab isn't looking to win an extremely competitive self-driving race against companies like Uber and Tesla. Instead, their long-term plan is to use ride share to trojan horse their customers into the global financial world. 

Grab recently released these quarterly numbers. This was basically what the company expected to report and caused no major stock price movements.



Q4 2024 Revenue grew 17% year-over-year (“YoY”), or 15% on a constant currency basis to $764 million

Q4 2024 On-Demand GMV grew 20% YoY, or 19% on a constant currency basis to $5.0 billion

Q4 2024 Profit for the quarter was $11 million

Q4 2024 Adjusted EBITDA improved by $61 million YoY to an all-time high of $97 million

Operating Cash Flow of $852 million and Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $136 million for the full year  



What is really exciting about this company is they don't need to do anything miraculous to continue growing. The growth of overall Southeast Asian economies is enough for the company to continue to grow. The company simply needs to continue doing what it is already doing and acquire other regional competitors as they go. By doing so, Grab could become a fintech giant in the region."

 The S&P futures price is an indication of market sentiment and investor expectations about the future direction of the stock market. A higher S&P futures price generally indicates optimism in the stock market, suggesting that investors expect the stock market to rise in the future. Conversely, a lower S&P futures price may indicate pessimism and suggest that the stock market may see a decline. However, it is important to note that the S&P futures price is only one of many indicators used to predict the stock market activity, and it's not always accurate as it depends on various factors that can influence the market."

comment,mjtztxd,stockstobuytoday,Undervalued Stocks,rigser,,1,"🚨 **Undervalued Opportunity: Mesoblast (MSB) at $2.20 AUD on the ASX** 🚨

Right now, Mesoblast (MSB) is trading at a significant discount, with a market capitalization of just **$2.8B AUD** and a stock price of **$2.20**. When you take a closer look at the fundamentals, the upside potential is undeniable.

Here’s why **MSB** is currently undervalued:

🔹 **Strong Revenue Potential**:  
Mesoblast is on track for **over $100M in quarterly revenue**, driven by its **groundbreaking treatments**. With expenses at just $20M per quarter, they’re poised to deliver **positive earnings** consistently, translating into substantial future growth.

🔹 **Off-Label Adult Sales**:  
With **RUX failure rates** around 40%, Mesoblast is seeing growing demand for off-label sales, and we could see 2-3 additional sales per week. As Ryoncil gains full approval for **Adults**, it’s positioned to capture a significant portion of the market currently dominated by RUX.

🔹 **Massive Market Expansion**:  
Once **Ryoncil** is fully approved for **Adults**, it could effectively **displace RUX** in the market, **multiplying Mesoblast’s market size by 3-4 times**. The growth potential here is huge, yet the market is not reflecting it right now.

🔹 **Strong Earnings Growth**:  
We’re expecting **63 cents per share in earnings growth** quarter over quarter — an impressive indicator of financial health and upward trajectory.

Given these factors, the current stock price of **$2.20** represents a **serious buying opportunity** for investors. Mesoblast’s future growth prospects and market expansion aren't reflected in its current valuation, making it a highly attractive stock to watch.

💡 **The bottom line?**  
Mesoblast is undervalued and positioned for massive growth in the coming quarters. Now is the time to take advantage of this opportunity before the market catches on.

Chris Giordano stated: ""To date 'Goliath' has been licensing to Maybacks Global Entertainment all of its content for the 35 channels it distributes globally on our streaming platforms and Over the Air broadcasting networks.""After careful examination of the relationship, the parties agreed that the strategic acquisition of the 40,000+ titles owned by Goliath was a natural metamorphosis between Maybacks and Goliath. Putting $11 million in assets on the balance sheet of Authentic Holdings is just one benefit. The long-lasting benefits and opportunities of owning the library is far more reaching than the asset itself and will provide Maybacks and Authentic Holdings with revenue growth and opportunities for years to come.""



Goliath owns priceless content of award-winning shows such as ""In Living Color"", ""The Cosby Show"",  and Steven Spielberg's ""Taken"". In addition, the library consists of movies like ""Open Range"" starring Kevin Costner, ""Blue Hawaii"" starring Elvis Presley, as well as  hundreds of documentaries and live concerts with ""A-Listers"" from both Hip Hop and Rock n Roll."

**⬆︎8.80%** **Lucid Motors**

**Finally, something Lucid investors can celebrate.** A Morgan Stanley analyst moved the luxury EV maker from “Sell” to “Hold,” saying the risk and reward are now balanced. He sees Lucid benefiting from AI advancements and potential partnerships, especially since it can work with both China and the West despite rising tensions.

**A RBC Capital analyst lowered his price target from $440 to $320.** His adjustment reflects concerns over Tesla's self-driving technology and robotaxi rollout. BYD’s ultra-fast charging technology reveal didn’t help either. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/18/tesla-gets-a-price-target-cut-from-rbc-as-ev-competition-heats-up.html))



⬇︎**12.31%** **Reddit**

**Redburn analysts just slapped the stock with a ""sell"" rating and a $75 price target.** They argue that Reddit’s explosive user growth was a gift from Google’s algorithm changes, but that boost is running out. Most new visitors aren’t sticking around or becoming logged-in users, which are key for ad revenue.

Since its debut, BE WATER, sourced from natural artesian springs nestled beneath North Carolina's Blue Ridge Mountain, has grown from a regional offering to a nationally recognized brand. A pivotal moment came in November 2020 when Greene Concepts secured a partnership with Walmart, the world's largest retailer, making BE WATER available to millions through Walmart.com. This milestone was followed by physical shelf placement in Walmart stores in the Southeast in mid-2024 is a testament to the brand's rising demand and operational scalability."

 The S&P futures price is an indication of market sentiment and investor expectations about the future direction of the stock market. A higher S&P futures price generally indicates optimism in the stock market, suggesting that investors expect the stock market to rise in the future. Conversely, a lower S&P futures price may indicate pessimism and suggest that the stock market may see a decline. However, it is important to note that the S&P futures price is only one of many indicators used to predict the stock market activity, and it's not always accurate as it depends on various factors that can influence the market."

The truth is that in the market you earn more by investing in young, transformative and disruptive companies, which offer unique services; they also must be capable of being leaders in what they offer and they must have proven this.

https://preview.redd.it/u65x38s5wmoe1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0df41d7dbb00c1b9dc9c52d4a42d4ffbb0859eb8

  
Large companies take years to build, or decades, and in the meantime the stock is subject to significant fluctuations for various reasons, rates at historic highs that weigh on valuations, wars, uncertainty, etc..

The key is to let the business grow, year after year, not by focusing on the stock, but on the continuous progress of the company's business, remaining invested for years or even decades.

To quote Buffet: ""The market is a system of redistribution of wealth, it takes away from those who don't have patience to give to those who have it""

**Margins will increase in the coming years and I will cite some reasons that lead me to be sure of this:**

* Constant growth in Elite membership, now on an international basis (70% gross margin at current membership price of CAD $35/annual in Canada, 15US $ international -> double from next year ), I estimate they will exceed 100K by end of this march
* Completion of Fastlender installations and license sale (high margin Saas model) expected soon
* The continued increase in market share in Canada and the reduction of competitors will allow HITI to increase prices and therefore gross margins
* Increase in white label products / elite inventory
* Recovery in demand for CBD products starting in Q1/Q2
* More favorable regulatory conditions in Canada
* Increasing scale will allow you to exploit operational leverage and increase overall efficiency
* Purecan Gmbh acquisition will prove accretive to Hiti's gross margins

**By 2030** **Hiti will have :**

* Over 1 bln annual revenue (not include Germany, only canada and cbd)
* Gross margins 30/40%
* 100 mln in fcf+ on an annual basis at a conservative level
* over 20 million subscribers with 1 mln in Elite members ( 5% of total )
* Expansion into new markets and verticals complementary to current products
* Innovations and strategies underway that we don't know about

High Tide is capturing market share every quarter, both from competitors and illicit market.

In three years, the company's market share grew from 4% to 11%, and it is well-positioned to reach 20% over the next 2/3 years just in Canada (probably also in Germany in the long term, on the medical side).

A higher S&P futures price generally indicates optimism in the stock market, suggesting that investors expect the stock market to rise in the future. Conversely, a lower S&P futures price may indicate pessimism and suggest that the stock market may see a decline.

In this case, the backstop agreement is related to the proposed business combination between Aesther Healthcare Acquisition Corp and Ocean Biomedical. The first backstop agreement, announced in September 2022, provided up to $40 million in support for the merger. The execution of a second backstop agreement increases the total amount of financial support available to $80 million.

This announcement is significant because it provides additional financial support for the proposed merger between Aesther Healthcare Acquisition Corp and Ocean Biomedical.

post,1bikzmw,stockstobuytoday,Anyone following CEL-SCI ($CVM)?,tippableoxhuvudw06,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/1bikzmw/anyone_following_celsci_cvm/,166,"Hey everyone! So, I was doing some reading up on healthcare innovations because, and I stumbled upon this article for CEL-SCI. Their research on rheumatoid arthritis treatment got me intrigued because it's not every day you hear about potential game-changers in the medical field.

Would love to hear some insights from people who’ve been following them for a while.

CEL-SCI looks like it's onto something big with their LEAPS technology, especially in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Unlike traditional meds that suppress the immune system, their approach with CEL-4000 aims to rebalance it, targeting RA without compromising our body's defenses against other threats like infections or cancer. It reshapes how we fight autoimmune diseases altogether.

&#x200B;

**Main Bits:**

* Current RA treatments mainly involve suppressing the immune system, which can have drawbacks like leaving patients vulnerable to infections and cancer.
* CEL-SCI's LEAPS technology, particularly CEL-4000, offers a fresh approach by rebalancing the immune system to target RA specifically while preserving its ability to fight off other threats.
* The article suggests using adaptive study designs and disease-related biomarkers in clinical trials, potentially revolutionizing how we approach treatment in autoimmune diseases.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** CEl-SCI’s new tech seems exciting, would love to get your thoughts on it."

1. **Resource Increase**: They've reported a significant boost in their resources - about 3.29 million tonnes at 6.4% graphitic carbon (Cg) and an additional 1.43 million tonnes at 7.4% Cg.
2. **Extended Mine Life**: This increase could potentially extend the mine's life by at least 8 years, a big deal since LDI is North America's only graphite-producing mine.
3. **Ramping Up Production**: To meet rising demand, they're planning to operate seven days a week starting Q2 this year, aiming for a 25,000-tonnes-per-year capacity.
4. **Future Outlook**: The CEO seems pretty optimistic about their position in the growing market, especially with the rise in electric vehicle manufacturing.

Anyway:

Here's a quick rundown on the current graphite market situation and Northern Graphite:

1. **China's Market Moves**: China, the world's largest graphite producer, has reinstated subsidies for domestic EVs, reducing graphite exports. Additionally, they plan to impose export controls on certain graphite exports starting December 1. This is significant as graphite is vital for EV batteries and industrial uses.
2. **Northern Graphite's Response**: Northern Graphite, the only graphite producer in North America, reported a sales volume increase of over 28% in Q3 2023 compared to Q2.
3. **Company Focus**: Northern Graphite, listed on the TSX Venture Exchange, focuses on producing natural graphite and upgrading it for use in green economy products, including EV battery materials and fuel cells."

At the recent Legorreta Cancer Center meeting in Providence, Dr. Jack A. Elias, MD, the Scientific Co-founder of Ocean Biomedical (NASDAQ: OCEA), presented groundbreaking research on tumor suppression in multiple cancer pathways. Dr. Elias discussed the vital role of Chitinase 3-like-1 (CHI3L1) in the development and progression of lung cancer, and shared promising results from the team's innovative work on the development of monospecific and bispecific antibodies against CHI3L1 and PD-1, demonstrating their efficacy in treating non-small cell lung cancer and glioblastoma multiforme. Ocean Biomedical is actively working towards Phase 1 clinical trials for these antibody therapeutics.

Dr. Elias' presentation highlighted the fascinating research conducted by his team on the role of CHI3L1 in regulating primary and metastatic lung cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, and other oncogenic pathways. The team's step-by-step experimentation resulted in the creation of effective monospecific antibodies, and a powerful bispecific antibody that triggered tumor apoptosis in metastatic melanoma, glioblastoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. These discoveries offer significant potential for advancing cancer therapies and improving patient outcomes, demonstrating the dedication and innovation of the team at Ocean Biomedical.

Leveraging advanced allogeneic stem cell technologies along with engineered viruses like vaccinia and adenovirus, Calidi's platforms aim to revolutionize cancer treatment by empowering the immune system to recognize and eradicate cancer cells.

**A Brief Overview of Calidi's Journey:**

Founded in 2014 and headquartered in San Diego, California, Calidi Biotherapeutics has been at the forefront of cutting-edge research and innovation in oncology. With its foundational patents dating back to 2015, Calidi has continuously expanded its portfolio, culminating in the acquisition of a subsidiary in Germany and the exclusive licensing of the NeuroNova technology from Northwestern University and the City of Hope in 2021.

**Seeking More Insights:**

As we delve deeper into Calidi's developments, I'm curious to hear if anyone has additional insights or thoughts on the company's trajectory. With its groundbreaking approach and strong foundation in research and development, Calidi Biotherapeutics seems poised to make significant strides in the fight against cancer.

Feel free to reach out to me via DM or leave a comment if you think there is any potential here, cheers."

They've secured $3 million from Sprott Resource Streaming and Royalty Corp., split into $1 million in secured debt and $2 million in royalty financing. This builds on their previous agreement from last year for their Quebec and Namibia mines.

Key points: They've increased their total loan from Sprott to about $14.6 million, including capitalized interest. Also, they've sold an additional 4% revenue royalty from their Quebec mine.

It looks like Northern is shoring up funds, possibly good news for their operational capacity. But, as always, more debt and royalties could impact future profits. Let's keep a close eye on how this plays out. Thoughts?"

She insisted on buying a supply of Flow water, the ones in those distinctive cardboard boxes. I was initially skeptical due to the cost, but I must admit it was quite impressive. This got me thinking that Flow must be raking in substantial profits if they can convince consumers like my wife to stock up on their product. To my surprise, After I got home I did some DD on the brand and discovered that Flow is actually a publicly traded company listed as $FLOW.TO.

What's even more intriguing is that I stumbled upon one of their recent press releases announcing a partnership with Live Nation to distribute their water at major concert venues. This is undoubtedly a significant move for them, and I'm looking forward to seeing Flow water available at events like the upcoming Drake concert in October.

I found it amusing that my wife's favorite water brand is publicly traded. Has anyone else ever come across a product they or their loved ones enjoy and then discovered it's a publicly traded company?

They've recently announced plans for a significant drilling campaign at two of their key projects in the Eastern Athabasca Basin of northern Saskatchewan. Here's a quick rundown:

* **Russell Lake Project**: They're gearing up for a 5,000-metre diamond drilling program over the next few months. This is quite a large-scale operation, considering it'll cover ten to twelve holes. What's more, this project is strategically located near Cameco's McArthur River Uranium Mine.
* **Moore Uranium Project**: After wrapping up at Russell Lake, they're planning to drill an additional 3,000 meters in eight to ten holes at their wholly-owned Moore Project. The focus here is on high-grade uranium, which is pretty intriguing.

The combined drill campaign across both projects totals 8,000 metres and is fully funded. The company seems confident in the discovery potential at both sites, especially given the high-grade mineralization in historical drill holes."

Anixa Bioscience is working on a breast cancer vaccine that targets a protein called α-lactalbumin. This protein is normally inactive post-lactation but is found in most TNBC tumors. The vaccine aims to trigger the immune system to recognize and combat cells expressing this protein, potentially stopping TNBC tumors before they grow.

The significance here is two-fold. First, TNBC is known for higher recurrence rates and accounts for a larger percentage of breast cancer deaths, despite being less common overall. Second, this approach represents a shift towards preemptive, immune-based strategies in cancer treatment. The technology, originally developed by Dr. Vincent Tuohy at Cleveland Clinic, is now being pursued by Anixa . It's a novel direction in oncology, especially for a cancer type that has limited treatment options. Anyone else have insights into these guys?

I've been exploring various industries and came across an interesting one called aquaculture. One company that caught my attention in this industry is Nocera (NCRA). Would love some insight on them from the community!

**Who Are They?**

Nocera, Inc. and its affiliates specialize in creating and manufacturing recirculation aquaculture systems for fish farming operations in Taiwan. Additionally, the company undertakes the construction, management, and operation of aquaculture facilities, and offers consulting, technology transfer, and aquaculture project management services to new and existing aquaculture management businesses. They were founded in 2014 and have headquarters in Taiwan. They currently have 7 sites approved for Taiwan and we are working closely with Solar EPC companies like JV energy technology company on future solar sharing fish farms.

**Nocera’s Land Based RAS System**

This product offers superior performance with minimal environmental disturbance. Its efficacy and versatility result in a cleaner and safer aquatic ecosystem. An emphasis on environmental preservation is a priority with this design. RAS systems enable efficient and economical use of water resources, while also maintaining optimal conditions for aquatic life. High stocking densities of fish can be achieved in Recirculating Aquaculture Systems, leading to a decrease in demand for fresh water. This system is also applicable for fresh water or salt water species.

**A Look Into The Company’s Management Team:**

Jeff Cheng – CEO

Howard Ruan – COO

Jim Chuang – CFO

Kevin Chou – CSO

I wasn’t able to find too much on their management team. Has anyone heard of anyone of these guys before?

**Current Market Standing**

As of now, Nocera is trading at around $1.39 USD. They have an avg volume of around 20k a day. Pretty small company overall, but a couple of years ago they were trading at nearly $7. Markets are pretty bear and volatile right now with most stocks being in the red. I think in the next bull this could really go for a run. Even if share price recovers half of what it once was, this could be huge for shareholders. Pretty nice entry point to start a position in my opinion, but im just feeling a little green around the ears.

The global demand for sustainable, healthy seafood is on the rise. From my numbers, Americans consumed 19 pounds of seafood per capita in 2020, and this number is growing. I think Nocera could be in a really good position to capitalize moving into American markets. The company’s business model is sustainable and doesn’t disrupt already existing ecosystems. Seems like a solid solution for the future. What are your thoughts?? Would love to hear some feedback in the comments below!

They've just finished an important early step in testing their new aircraft, called Midnight, and they did it super fast - in just three months! This company is working on electric planes that can take off and land straight up and down, which could totally change how we get around cities.

So, here's what's new: The Midnight plane got some advanced batteries installed, straight from Archer's own facilities in San Jose, California. This is a big deal because it means they're getting closer to making these planes a regular thing. They've moved past the first phase of their tests, doing all sorts of flying maneuvers to see how well the plane performs. Now, they're moving into the next phase, aiming to fly the plane in a way that mimics how it would in a normal trip, which is pretty exciting.

What's really interesting is that Archer is aiming to make trips across town way faster than driving, saying flights could be as quick as 10-20 minutes. The Midnight is designed to carry four people and be ready to fly again quickly after landing.

I'm curious to see how this goes and what it could mean for getting around in the future. Does anyone else have more info on Archer Aviation or thoughts on electric air taxis? Would love to hear what you think!"
comment,krgut1n,stockstobuytoday,Anyone checking out $ACHR?,Doubledolla,,2,"I think it's a good sector to at least diversify some $ towards. Electric only cars I believe, have been overhyped and will fizzle with demands of battery element availability/ competition and mining ethicacy. Hydrogen / hybrid is probably more the way of the future. That said, a lot of cities have noise ordinances and are getting stricter in this area. Electric flying is somewhat minimal in that category when compared to combustion, and that's one area I think these have a future. Also air polution/ green initiatives are also part of the plan ( albeit charging comes from coal consumption  typically). As long as there's no issues with testing protocols, it could pay big returns. I like the cost to use model as the time saved seems reasonable compared to typical Lyft/Uber cost and time to destination can vary and time could be lost due to unseen additional traffic delays. Not so much in the sky. Really, the main exposure is loss to investment if something along the path to certification goes wrong and investment tanks...... worth the upside with minimal exposure, I think.Also think there's space fore more than one company ans compition is best for the consumer. Joby is anoth in this space fighting for recognition and territory. Don't put all your eggs in this basket, but the overall outlook is promising. My 2 cents"

But here's the twist - this isn't the end of the road for e.GO. Instead, they've got until June 10, 2024, to bump up their share price back to $1.00 for at least 10 consecutive days. Think of it like a video game challenge where the company has to level up its stock price within a set time. This situation is a snapshot of the broader EV sector, which is all about innovation, overcoming hurdles, and driving towards a sustainable future. For those new to the scene, the EV market is where traditional automotives meet cutting-edge technology, aiming to revolutionize how we travel.

2. **Grace Period**: The company has 180 days, until June 10, 2024, to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price requirement.
3. **Potential for a Turnaround**: Despite this challenge, Next.e.GO is actively considering options to meet Nasdaq’s requirements, indicating a proactive approach to this hurdle.

They also have an MoU with BMW to supply them with all of their zone 1 mining production. Including a $15M USD pre payment… has anyone seen this happen for other companies before?

Just checking if anyone has their eyes on any stocks at the moment. The markets are taking quite a hit this week, and my portfolio is feeling the heat. Just looking to diversify a bit.

Someone in my cord group mentioned Abacus Life. Apparently, they released their second-quarter results a few days back, and the numbers are looking pretty impressive. Their revenue saw a solid 30% year-over-year growth, reaching $18.3 million. What's even more impressive is that their underlying net income went up by 40% compared to the previous year, hitting $6.4 million. I must admit, their growth is catching my attention, but I'm not too familiar with the life insurance industry. Any insights?

I read somewhere that in the USA, life insurance policies can be treated as physical assets and sold to third parties. I find that concept pretty intriguing – it adds a unique twist to their business model.

They also launched Abacus Marketplace last week which is projected to make their whole business faster, easier and more reliable. They talk about incorporating smart contracts and blockchain tech too. Have a read here: [https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/abacus-life-announces-launch-abacus-120000011.html](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/abacus-life-announces-launch-abacus-120000011.html) 

Interestingly, the stock itself has gained about 20% in the past month and is steadily climbing towards its six-month high. Considering this, it might just be a great opportunity to jump in at this entry point. But before I make a move, I'd really appreciate some advice. Feel free to drop your thoughts below "

**What I'm Curious About:**

* **Sustainability:** Is their growth sustainable? Or is it just good PR?
* **Competition:** How do they stack up against other players in the clean energy space?

comment,kvm5njg,stockstobuytoday,$NGMD.V's Needle Free Injections,Ok_File_153,,1,"Yeah, they got a 5 year distribution contract with SolM for 203M. Spread over the 5 years that’s 40m/year. Promising a 70% profit margin. Sol m completed training with their sales agents in January. Uk, Spain, France, governments have approved insujet for coverage under health care. Only thing left to do is go up to the doctors(which is SOLM’s job) and say “bro, your country will pay for it, just show it to your patients. No more needle wastes, no more needles hitting the streets. Kids gonna prefer this. Needle phobics will love this.” Boom sales. 

Also major side point NO ONE knows about! Insujet is also approved to administer Ozempic. And if you don’t know what that is, you’ve been under a rock. 

Now look at the Mexico sales that came in. They have been shipping units down there like crazy. Every 500 units is $220,000($400 a unit roughly). That’s in accordance with their deal with ScienceLink in Mexico. And they have a contract for 5000 this year!!! That doesn’t even include the fact that Mexico already increased the order by 1500 units!. 

So let’s do some math. 
Company shows -$2m in loss every year right? 
500units = $220k, with me? 
6500 units = $2.82m correct me if I’m wrong

2.82m income - 2m operating costs(+.5m for expansion, promotions, production costs, etc) 

= $600K in profit(yeah yeah take off taxes, hiring on extra staff, probably left with nothing.) 

But that’s just the Mexico stuff bringing thing up to a nice even net balance. 

Now go to the math on what a 5 year $203M contract adds to that?

By my viewing! Company should be at $27.00 a share within two years. 

However $25million for the whole company? Who’s to say someone doesn’t wanna just buy this up, and trash it, or part it out. Who knows.

I came across an article about AI being used to help aid forestry and wildfire risk mitigation. The company is called "" Genesis AI Corp.""

If anyone has insights into the company or this kind of technology let me know! This is the DD i've done (broken down into smaller points). Here it is:  

1. **Specialization:** Genesis AI focuses on remote sensing and data analysis, applying AI for risk mitigation in forestry and mining sectors.
2. **Woodlands.ai Platform:** Their main project, Woodlands.ai, is designed to predict forest fire behaviors, quicken response times, and enhance forest resilience by revolutionizing land management techniques.
3. **Government Backing:** Significant investments from Canadian ($256 million) and U.S. ($7 billion) governments highlight the urgency and potential in wildfire management, a sector with high economic and environmental stakes.

What this means is that O3 is expanding its exploration territory in an area known for significant gold deposits. For those who might not be deep into mining lingo, think of it like a video game where O3 Mining is grabbing more valuable land, potentially loaded with gold, to boost its resources and influence in the game. This move fits neatly into the bigger picture of the mining industry, which is all about finding and controlling areas rich in minerals, especially gold.

**Highlighted Main Points**

* O3 Mining acquired Kinebik Properties from NewOrigin and Cameron Properties from Globex, expanding its control over 40 km of strike in the Casa Berardi break.
* The company is betting big, paying cash and shares for these properties, signaling strong confidence in their value.
* This expansion aligns with the global narrative of mining companies striving to secure more resources, especially in gold-rich areas.

**TL;DR** O3 Mining Inc. is beefing up its portfolio by acquiring key mining properties in a gold-rich area, which is great news for the company's growth and presence in the sector.

*PR Contains Video Update!!! ⬆️* 

Check the daily  chart. Wish I could add a picture of it! 😭 

\---

MIAMI--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--ShiftPixy, Inc. (Nasdaq: PIXY) (“ShiftPixy” or “the Company”), a Florida-based national staffing enterprise which designs, manages, and sells access to a disruptive, revolutionary platform that facilitates employment in the rapidly growing Gig Economy, today released a video further detailing its new “Fast Fill” recruiting technology first announced December 13, 2022. As reported at the time, many of the multi-unit fast food operators that endured the pandemic are now seeing activity pick up, but finding themselves unable to fill open positions, often due to weaker than ever “bench strength”. Fast Fill, which ShiftPixy is launching with a “Need Workers?” marketing campaign aimed at restaurant operators, is designed to directly reach available workers through mobile technology, encouraging immediate sign up for available QSR (quick service restaurant) shifts.

Smartphones have become a necessity of daily life, and have dramatically altered how people access information. Studies show that 94% of consumers look for local information on their smartphones, and 90% of those audiences take action as a result. The widespread use of smartphones to search the internet, shop, be entertained, and find local information provides marketers with the ability to target an audience that is constantly connected.

ShiftPixy’s extensive analytics enable its fast fill algorithm to precisely identify and target potential shift workers for population. Once a potential shift worker is identified, the fast fill algorithm connects with them to present shift work opportunities and immediately move them through a high touch digital process to put them to work on the opportunities they select.

“Keeping the bench full with qualified workers remains a challenge for today’s QSR operators, and our Fast Fill mobile technology allows them to reach the workers of today quickly and efficiently where they live and socialize,” said ShiftPixy Co-Founder and CEO, Scott Absher. “As discussed in the accompanying video, our most recent tests with our fast food clients needing to fill as many as 100 openings has exceeded expectations, turning what once was a six-month endeavor into perhaps a two-week success story. We’re capturing the attention of interested shift workers, motivating them to work and by so doing, accelerating the growth of our QSR clients.”

**About ShiftPixy**   
ShiftPixy is a disruptive human capital services enterprise, revolutionizing employment in the Gig Economy by delivering a next-gen platform for workforce management that helps businesses with shift-based employees navigate regulatory mandates, minimize administrative burdens and better connect with a ready-for-hire workforce. With expertise rooted in management’s more than 25 years of workers’ compensation and compliance programs experience, ShiftPixy adds a needed layer for addressing compliance and continued demands for equitable employment practices in the growing Gig Economy.

Saw this recent noco-noco news that looked interesting but wanted to get your take on it.

&#x200B;

Article mentions they’re developing some new battery tech, X-SEPA separators. Apparently they have improved capacity retention rates and charging performance in various temperature conditions. I'm not exactly a tech savant here but overall seems like the batteries have better performance and a wide range of applications, from EVs to smartphones.

&#x200B;

Also on the manufacturer's end it costs them nothing to use. There’s no need for extra investments on their end to implement, seems like a plug and chug.

Haven't heard about them before but all the recent progress seems promising.

post,14h3a0e,stockstobuytoday,Thoughts on Uranium Mining?,emiljenfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/14h3a0e/thoughts_on_uranium_mining/,59,"Hey guys, we are almost at the weekend which is big news! Def need a little chill weekend but before the day ends just thought I’d fire out a little post as I’m curious to hear some takes on small cap mining, specifically Uranium. 

I’ve always been a mining guy myself, and one of the biggest challenges when talking to companies and investors is that everyone claims they have big shiny rocks in the ground. Or that their deposit is beside some mine that pumped out 2+ million ounces last year or whatever. It's really hard to narrow it down to who is actually profitable. 

One sector I’ve been checking out recently is the uranium sector. I’ve overheard a couple of brokers I work with that they are interested in looking into some uranium deals due to the big global demand for it recently. It got me curious to do some research and digging on it myself which resulted in me coming across Myriad Uranium (M.CN). 

What caught my attention is that they actually operate out of Niger Africa, which isn’t really a massive country for uranium exploration currently but that is going to change soon. The proof behind that is that a lot of new players want to enter the scene there based on recent news of high grade uranium samples being discovered by Orano. However, Myriad has that first movers advantage everyone wants to know about. Myriad has licenses running through the Tim Mersoï Basin which is Africa’s largest uranium deposit according to various sources. On top of that Myriads Geophysics program will be beginning later this summer and into the fall which has their community pretty amped up. 

I know I mentioned early that so many mining companies say stuff like this but Myriad operates in a very unique area. There are not a ton of players in their area yet which is why they stand out to me a little more than others. Would love for any of you to take a look into them with me, and happy to get some discussion going here! Let me know what you guys think! "

Meet sugarBEAT®, a non-invasive wearable glucose sensor that just received the stamp of approval from the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA). 

But wait, there's more! Nemaura's been working behind the scenes with TPMENA, their licensee in the Middle East, to make this happen. After over a year of hard work and collaboration, the SFDA's approval is a major breakthrough. And let's talk numbers: Saudi Arabia has one of the highest diabetes prevalence rates in the world, with a staggering 18.3% of adults affected. The potential impact of sugarBEAT® is huge.

Think about it – nearly 9 million people with diabetes in Saudi Arabia are unaware of their condition. That's where sugarBEAT® comes in, offering a way to manage and improve metabolic health. Nemaura's got their sights set on a larger mission: enhancing diabetes and metabolic health management across the Gulf and beyond. 

**Highlighted Main Points:**

* Nemaura Medical scores big with SFDA approval for sugarBEAT®, a non-invasive wearable glucose sensor.
* Over a year of collaboration with TPMENA leads to this breakthrough in diabetes care.

Their successful share purchase agreement with 1412814 BC Ltd. (""814BC"") has resulted in Q Battery acquiring 100% ownership of 814BC's common shares, and all it took was 5,800,000 of Q Battery's own common shares. This move has placed them firmly in control of the mineral-rich Pontax River area in Quebec's James Bay region.

**Highlighted Main Points:**

2. The acquired shares provide Q Battery access to mineral claims spanning 5,376 hectares within the ""Lithium Triangle,"" an area renowned for its lithium potential.
3. The transaction's approval by the Canadian Securities Exchange is pending. Importantly, the proposed transaction does not constitute a fundamental change or trigger a change of control within the Company.

They're part of a pioneering effort to extract vital metals from the ocean floor, which could play a big role in supporting the shift towards clean energy. This effort puts them at the heart of discussions on sustainable resource extraction.

Recently, a peaceful protest by Greenpeace brought attention to the environmental discussions surrounding deep-sea mining. It highlights the ongoing dialogue between industry players and environmental groups about the best ways to balance technological advancement with ecological care. The Metals Company is actively involved in research aimed at understanding the environmental impacts of their work, contributing to a broader conversation about responsible resource use.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on how technology and environmental stewardship can go hand in hand in this new frontier. The Metals Company's role in this space seems to be a noteworthy example of striving for innovation while engaging with important ecological questions. Anyone else following this or have insights into the sustainable practices being considered in deep-sea mining?"

Fortunately, I had a chance to try the **Streetbeat** app personally, and I can make a few comments. First, using data-based machine learning algorithms really works well with ready-to-trade investment solutions from professional financiers. It saves a lot of time and diversifies investment decisions. Secondly, when investing with this app in stocks, DeFi in cryptocurrency, you have an opportunity to trust the data of reputable hedge funds, not guesses. Anyway, I like the policy of democratizing data for everyday investors."

They just launched this AI/metaverse air cargo platform, which sounds pretty wild.  And they seem committed to renewable energy for their crypto mining operations. Plus, they recently announced a stock dividend.  It's a total mixed bag, but I can't deny the ambition.

Full disclosure, this isn't financial advice. You've got to do your own research. But if you're looking for a wildcard stock with a lot of potential upside (and downside), this one's worth checking out."

Baird, which is primarily a microwave ablation device provider in China, has recently expanded into the U.S. market after receiving FDA clearance. They reported some impressive financial numbers, so I thought it was worth a deeper look.

In terms of numbers, Baird Medical’s revenue reached $13.1 million, marking a 13.8% year-over-year increase. Even more notable, their net income jumped by 85.8% to $4.4 million. They’re also gaining traction in the U.S. after FDA clearances, targeting the large thyroidectomy market, which reportedly sees around 150,000 procedures annually. The company completed a business combination with ExcelFin Acquisition Corp. earlier this month, and Baird Medical’s shares now trade on Nasdaq under the ticker ""BDMD.""

Anyone else following this stock? It’s interesting to see their strategy as they enter the U.S. market. Let me know if you’ve got more insights into the company or how this tech might shake up the thyroid treatment space"

Seems like EveryLife, a subsidiary of PublicSqaure, is giving back in a massive way.

I keep hearing about PublicSquare and all the values they represent, so news like this is pretty exciting to see that they’re putting their money where their mouth is so to speak. If anyones followed them for a while, I'd love to hear more insights about when they’ve done similar things. 

&#x200B;

Here’s the main points summarized:

* EveryLife donated over 523,000 diapers and nearly 123,000 wipes in the first quarter of 2024
* Their ""Buy For A Cause"" program partners with pro-life organizations and allows consumers to purchase and donate diaper and wipe bundles directly to pregnancy resource centers
* They're also running diaper drives and partnering with various organizations to assist families in need

They're opening up a second office in Guadalajara, Mexico, in the La Colonia Americana area. Sounds like they’re really focusing on growing their nearshoring capabilities, which makes sense with how popular it’s becoming for U.S. companies trying to keep operations close by without the heavy costs.

This new office will handle a bunch of different roles like customer service, tech support, and training. It seems like a good move to improve efficiency for their clients. Plus, they already have operations in Mexico, so this just adds to their presence there. The COO, Ajay Khare, mentioned that the new location has a solid talent pool, which is an advantage for the company.

Nearshoring is clearly on the rise, and with 80% of companies in North America thinking about it, this move seems pretty timely for Aeries. Anyone else been following their recent moves or have more insights into how this could impact them long-term?"

This patent covers a two-step vaccination process involving a DNA vector encoding multiple HIV antigens in virus-like particles (VLPs) for the initial boost, followed by a second round using GeoVax's vector platform. This innovative approach is a significant leap forward in HIV prevention.

**Highlighted Main Points:**

* **Innovative Vaccination Approach:** GeoVax's method involves a dual-step process that starts with a DNA vector encoding various HIV antigens in virus-like particles. This primes the immune system. The second step employs GeoVax's vector platform using an MVA viral vector to amplify the response.
* **CEO David Dodd's Insights:** Dodd emphasizes their current focus on a next-gen COVID-19 vaccine in Phase 2 trials and a cancer immunotherapy program, with Gedeptin® leading the charge in Phase 1/2 clinical trials. While HIV research isn't the primary focus at the moment, it remains a crucial part of their broader development strategy.
* **Promising HIV Study Results:** GeoVax's MVA-vectored HIV vaccine played a key role in an experimental combinational HIV therapy study. The trial's goal was a functional cure for HIV-positive individuals. The treatment demonstrated exceptional immunogenicity, especially in T cell immunity, even in compromised immune systems due to HIV infection.

**TLDR:**

GeoVax Labs, Inc. scores a big win with a patent for their cutting-edge HIV vaccine approach. The method involves a two-step vaccination process, setting a new standard in HIV prevention.

So basically, they’ve successfully integrated their latest battery systems with wireless chargers. What's super cool is that these wireless charging capabilities are on par with traditional wired chargers, which is a big win for convenience and efficiency. 

Instead of dealing with tangled wires and manual monitoring while charging EV cars, you can just let them juice up wirelessly. Plus, with Electrovaya's monitoring platform, EVISION, you can keep tabs on everything remotely, making operations smoother and more efficient.

Just saw some big news about Canoo Inc. ($GOEV) that I wanted to share. They just got approval for their Oklahoma City place to be a Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ). This seems like a pretty big deal for how they make and sell their electric vehicles.

So, what's the big deal with this approval? It means Canoo can save some money on parts they bring in from other countries and on the electric vehicles they sell outside the U.S. They say over 90% of their parts are from the U.S. and friends, and this approval lets them cut costs. For cars they sell abroad, it could make things up to 5% cheaper on some parts. And for cars sold here, they can wait longer to pay some taxes and fees, which helps them use their money better.

This seems like a win for Canoo because it could help them make and sell their electric vehicles more efficiently. They're also planning to grow their site in Oklahoma City, which could mean more jobs and more cars made in the U.S. What do you all think about this? Does anyone know more about Canoo or how this might help them out?"

They IPO'd around 6 months ago and no insiders have sold shares which is a great sign. This one is bottomed out sitting near the all time low with very active PRs.

SHORTS ARE COMPLETELY TRAPPED AND HAVENT COVERED. Micro floats are the penny stock theme right now with $DWTX running from $1 to $30 and this one has the same 1m float.

**This $15M MC Company effectively managed the supply chain requirements of major online retailers such as Amazon ($2.5T), Walmart ($750B), and Wayfair ($6B)**

**They secured a $1.5M sales agreement just recently, and 2 days ago secured distribution agreements with Kelun Pharmaceutical which is around a $50B Company**

$LSH operates three major regional warehousing and distribution centers in the United States, located in Illinois, Texas, and California. **These centers collectively cover approximately 85,000 square feet with 35 docks and can handle up to 3,000 cubic meters of freight daily**.

There isn’t any DD out I can refer too but I already started looking in the company. The financials and the stock performance is what made me like the company. I All this info is from otcmarkets and they are not audited so keep that in mind. They did 10.4M in revenue compared to 1.8M the previous year, also they were net profitable for the past 3 consecutive quarters. They also have a healthy balance sheet 24M in assets and only 6M in liabilities. Hard to find OTC with financials like this one and I think the next thing the company needs to do is audit their financials.

The stock doesn't have any selling pressure and no one really knows the stock yet so it doesn’t really get much volume. The chart pretty much makes it clear, one thing to note is that the longterm performance is actually better than any otc because it’s literally like the only pinksheet without sellers.

The revenue growth rate is the main that stood out to me so I think that might be the real kicker

Listen  up! Im about to present a once-in-a-generation opportunity to 75x your  money\*\*.\*\* Too much, or too good to be true? Im being conservative. Hear  me out.

**First, I shall Flex:**

1. I  am an MD and a Professor. To spell out the obvious, I have insight into  what matters in the medical world. Many pure researchers lack this  (cough cough Elisabeth Bik). In addition, As medical school faculty, If I  can't figure it out, I know who to ask.
2. I started investing (profitably) before most of you were born.

Why  flex? To make it abundantly clear, my opinion on biotech investing  matters just a little. With that said, once more, listen up!

**The Pickle:**

You  youngins haven't noticed, but Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of  death in the US. Currently, Alzheimer's is an epidemic. The kicker is,  there is NO effective treatment.

The  FDA needed a drug so desperately they approved Aduhelm. This drug has  significant adverse events. The risk of brain swelling requires serial  Brain MRIs. It also requires a demented patient to sit through an IV  infusion (every six weeks) and costs more than $50k. Most incredible is  that Biogen's medication is NO BETTER THAN A SUGAR PILL in two separate  trials (so remember Biogen's drug sucks for a different point I'll make  later).

Again, for emphasis, the  FDA still approved it because the need is that severe. President Biden  recently pointed out that Alzheimer's disease could soon cost the nation  over a trillion dollars.

**The Fix: $SAVA**

Cassava  Science's revolutionary Alzheimer's drug, Simufilam, improved cognitive  function in its CMS trial. The degree and duration of improvement have  NEVER been achieved, EVER for AD (Alzheimer's dementia)! It's historic.  It also enhanced behavior. Family members with AD patients know that  behavior is the overwhelming factor for family, but unfortunately, it  doesnt get enough attention. Lastly, and critically to patients (and the  discussion ahead), there were NO significant adverse events.

Yes,  we can argue about nuances like study design, the N, etc. A genuine  criticism of the study is its initially open-label. However, biased  critics will ignore Simufilams effect has been far more robust than the  usual placebo effect (88% vs. 30%). Those with ulterior motives  conveniently forget that a placebo arm is being introduced to the  ongoing phase 2 CMS study as we speak.

Without  getting too technical, the best way to settle the few sincere  criticisms is Phase 3 trials. There is no valid argument against this  statement. This is one of those few moments where it's safe to use  absolute phrases. If you take away only one point from this article,  then remember, Phase 3 trials should move forward. The study will start  early to mid-October at the dismay of Jordan Thomas (the villain, more  about him later). Anyone who disagrees with further testing is not after  the truth or and they are certainly not being objective. They are also  threatening a much-needed potential breakthrough therapy. Be angry,  fellow apes, be angry. Im just getting started, BTW.

Do  market gurus like Blackrock and Vanguard believe this is a big deal?  They do. That is why the stock price went from < $1 to an ATH of  $147. So is it a buy at $50 (market cap of 2 billion)? My advice to my  family is to load up! Now let's address why the stock crashed in the  first place.

**The Villan and His Massacre:**

Jordan  Thomas, a scumbag lawyer, presented the FDA with a ""Citizens Petition.""  A team shorting SAVA drafted this said Citizens Petition (not lawsuit)  out of concern for patient SAFETY (remember this point, it is critical  to understanding motives). If that wasn't enough, Jordan Thomas filed  another two addendums following the petitions over the last two weeks.

Essentially, it was around 70 pages full of technical jargon and a myriad of inconsequential details. **The document was scary to read as an MD**.  Im sure the average person, first, shit in their pants, and, second,  sold their shares. SAVA fell 55% in 3 days (overreaction play in the  making? most definitely). As emotions have settled, this blog ([https://ad-science.org/](https://ad-science.org/)),  Cassava itself, and many experts, including myself, rightly called it  biased and fiction. The essentials from the petition and rebuttals.

1. Jordan  Thomas has tried three times to halt clinical research on a drug that  patients are literally dying as they wait. WTF!? Why, why why?? If you  aren't angry, somethings wrong with you. JT states he is concerned for  patient safety. However, as also mentioned above (multiple times), there  is no evidence that Simufilam harmed a patient, period. So as expected,  JT is unable to offer proof of patient harm. You read that correctly.  In over seventy pages, there is no mention of patient harm. Then why did  JT cite safety as his concern, despite having NO evidence? Because that  is the \*only\* reason, the FDA will halt trials. Again, if Simufilam is  safe and has shown to be a potential treatment, then the study shall  continue. Oh, did I mention that the vast majority (>90%) of these  petitions fail? Did I also note that Jordan Thomas' track record is  horrendous (3% success rate)? Synopsis: JT is an incompetent lawyer who  uses a failed method to frighten investors from their position using FUD  in its purest form.
2. Then  why the massive selloff? As I mentioned earlier, reading an enormous  document full of details, even I, a literal verifiable SAVAge (maybe  even a SAVAnt?) and professor/physician, was overwhelmed and anxious.  Ultimately, I did not sell a single share. I did, however, increase my  position by 30%. With that said, Im not surprised the masses started  selling. Clearly, though, it was an overreaction. Even more apparent,  it's an \*opportunity\*—a second chance to buy the stock on clearance.

**The Financials:**

$SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. Funding isn't a near-term issue.

Fifty  million patients are suffering from AD globally. 6 million of those  patients reside in the US. Let's say SAVA captures 1/4 of the American  market and nothing internationally. Further, let's say the therapy costs  $20k annually, just a bit over a third the cost of aducanumab (Biogen's  soon to fail drug):

1,500,000 patients X $20,000 X 5 multiple = $150,000,000,000

That  calculation is ridiculously conservative for a Simufilam if it ends up  as good as it looks (in a market with no other effective treatment  options). The current stock price is $50. The overly conservative  valuation would put SAVA's SP at $3750

The above does not factor in SavaDx or expanded label use for seizures and other types of dementia.

**Once Again Elaborating On The Need:**

If  you have a heart attack, Stroke, Pneumonia, or any of the leading  causes of death, there are treatments- actually, many treatments. I'm a  hospital-based physician and regularly see all the common causes of  death, so why does AD stand out? Again, there is no effective treatment.  Thats devastating for patients, but families? It's not uncommon for  families to drop their loved ones off in the ER because they ""can't  handle it anymore."" This market is massive and unaddressed! Severely,  painfully, and gravely unaddressed.

I  have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires  (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process. JT is only the  face of this farce. Behind him are many short positions making a 100  million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their  short-term gain. There is something far more concerning.

**The Plot Thickens:**

What  I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or  short-term price action. There is something much more sinister. Biogen  has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved. Now it  is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a  problem:

FDA advisory committee  voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then  saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently,  a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and  Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to  support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and  Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the  country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's  AD drug. This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you  to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no  other therapy on the market. Well, what happens if a new, more effective  medication shows up?

**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**

Back  to our Villian JT. JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the  initial ""Citizens Patetion"") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works. Why? I  speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous  whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried  about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in  profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is  more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer. There is  little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less. When that  happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug. Biogen already  has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to  rejuvenate the companies earnings. Then expediently and as expected,  Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.

I  believe that is the root issue. Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become  furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam! A group of us have  gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to  investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).

**Short term price action:**

1. Im  expecting the SP to bounce. After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a  perfect overreaction play. If you dont know what Im talking about, you  can look up ""overreaction with reversion to the mean.""
2. Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within ""weeks to months.""
3. Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks. (""Soon"" per Remi)
4. Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.

\#SAVA's  float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted  with utilization of >90%. It'll take very little to make SAVA move,  big. Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.

I  have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on  SAVA. My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!). I'll  finish with one last piece of advice. Over 19 years of investing, my  most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading  and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment  by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further  propagated by ""experts"" tweeting and commenting with their hidden  agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual  published results, but apparently, her opinion counts? Comments of her  blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical  vernacular to cause panic. Something along the lines of, ""oh, he sounds  smart, so he must be right."" or ""That sounds complicated, he must be on  to something."" In reality, Jordan Thomas screamed fire in a theater.  Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical  details are fooling many. DFV saw something well before masses, and he  was paid handsomely for it.

If my  opinion piece has motivated you to join SAVA's fight against Biogen,  then buy shares, spread the knowledge. Sleep well if you decide to go in  with me, knowing this is a righteous fight: six million AD patients vs.  a slimy lawyer, his short crew, and big Pharma.

I am long. I have been wrong many times, and I am not a financial advisor. Do your own DD before making any decisions."

Join us as we delve into their latest triumph – the initiation of treatment for the third patient in a groundbreaking clinical trial in collaboration with Moffitt Cancer Center. Our focus? A novel chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy designed to take on the challenges posed by ovarian cancer.

**Highlighted Main Points:**

* Anixa Biosciences, Inc.  partners with Moffitt Cancer Center to launch treatment for the third patient in a pioneering clinical trial.
* The clinical trial (NCT05316129) takes place at Moffitt Cancer Center and is a Phase 1 dose-escalation study.
* The primary objectives include evaluating therapy safety, determining the maximum tolerated dose of T-cells targeting follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), and preliminarily assessing clinical activity.
* Patients in the trial have progressive disease and have undergone at least two therapeutic interventions.
* The third patient receives the same dose of engineered T-cells as the first and second patients.
* Assuming safety is confirmed in the third patient, Anixa plans to initiate treatment for the second cohort in Q4 2023, with three times the cell dose compared to the first cohort.
* Anixa's approach is called chimeric endocrine receptor T-cell (CER-T) therapy, targeting FSHR, which is exclusively expressed on ovarian cells in healthy adult females.
* While CAR-T therapy has shown promise for hematological tumors, Anixa's approach targets solid tumors, like ovarian cancer, where effective targeting is more complex.
* Dr. Robert Wenham, Principal Investigator of the trial and Chair of Gynecologic Oncology Program at Moffitt Cancer Center, expresses optimism about the trial's progress.
* Dr. Amit Kumar, Chairman and CEO of Anixa Biosciences, highlights the completion of the first cohort despite slow patient enrollment and anticipates moving forward to the next higher dose cohort.

**TLDR:** 

Attention, biotech enthusiasts! Anixa Biosciences, Inc.  is making waves with its partnership with Moffitt Cancer Center. Together, they've launched treatment for the third patient in a groundbreaking clinical trial targeting ovarian cancer. This Phase 1 trial aims to assess therapy safety, determine optimal T-cell doses, and evaluate clinical activity. Patients with progressive disease and multiple prior interventions are enrolled. Anixa's innovative approach, called chimeric endocrine receptor T-cell (CER-T) therapy, uniquely targets ovarian cells through the FSHR receptor. If safety is confirmed, the next cohort will receive a higher cell dose. Though slow patient enrollment is common, the completion of the first cohort is a significant milestone.

They’re basically a VC firm with over 70 investments in the hottest sectors including AI, block chain, biotech, mining, cannabis

The CEO, Sheldon actually has a insane track record and had multiple unicorn exits in the past. Going to post a lot of DD on this company and their holdings

Being a VC firm, $IDKFF has exposure into equity in early seed financing rounds with companies that ordinary investors can’t even touch, especially with the accredited investor rule for private companies. This gives IDKFF shareholders a low entry points and a highly favourable risk/reward on their investments. Basically being able to invest in potential unicorns prior to going public or being bought out. With active investments in currently over 70 companies this is one to watch out for.

$IDKFF CEO Sheldon Inwentash had success in the past with leading a holdings company, Pinetree Capital with some unicorn investments including Queenston Mining (acquired by Osisko Mining Corp. for $550-million), Aurelian Resources (acquired by Kinross for $1.2-billion) and Gold Eagle Mines (acquired by Goldcorp for $1.5-billion) just to name some.

I looked through some of IDKFF investments and already seen a few potential unicorns. G
oing to post about them next. They have a YouTube channel where they sit down and talk with the management of the companies that they’re invested in.

Here’s a little more info on just 3 out of the 70 companies in IDKFF holdings

Micropayments - TODAQ (ledger-less ""blockchain"" working with banks) enables, for the first time ever, cost effective (fraction of a penny), controlled and convenient Micropayments. TODAQ is working with the likes of Google, Banks such as CIBC and RBC. As well as institutions like Cambridge Univeristy and many more. A 30 year dream the founders of the internet weren't able to achieve is complete.
 
AI to AI - HyperCycle is being described as the ""Internet of AI"". An AI that talks to other AI to complete tasks for a user; fixed fee and only paid when product is delivered to stop costs of recruitment for the first time ever. Allowing you to comfortably go outside of your ""friend network"". Ben Goertzel the founder of SingularityNet is behind this project with Toufi Saliba. They have had talks with Nvidia. Sheldon was then later at the recent Nvidia conference.
 
Neuroscience  - Neurable enables, for the first time ever, brainwaves/signals to be measured effectively, without the need for an invasive chip like seen with Elon Musk's company NeuraLink. Neurable is doing this through headphones in partnership with headphone company Master & Dynamic.

**Highlighted Main Points:**

* Myriad has a shot at a 75% stake in Rush's Copper Mountain Project, covering 110 mineral claims in Wyoming.
* Historical data suggests rich uranium deposits, including the Arrowhead Mine with a 500,000 lbs eU3O8 yield.
* Copper Mountain's got a potential 2,000 drill holes and numerous unexplored high-grade uranium spots.

However, even seasoned investors can find some use out of this by getting back to the basics. This quick guide isn't meant to focus on financial metrics, but in an effort to explore companies based on the world around us.

Preface: This is directed for individuals that are just starting to invest, in hopes of empowering them to continue to grow upon the knowledge they learn on in this post! This is also a post to help highlight a new social investing platform I've been building called [Mainstreet](https://mainstreetportfolio.com/) (currently in beta) that helps you invest with your friends, track your portfolios, and build communities with one another. Happy investing!

**How To Find Stocks (for the Normal Investor)**

One of the most common questions I get when talking to someone just getting into investing, is something along the lines of “Which stocks are good?” or “How do I find stocks to invest in?”. Some of the reasons individuals choose not to invest is due to the “lack of knowledge” or perhaps they are “intimidated by the market”. These are all valid reasons to not invest, but I feel like by providing the education and resources to learn about these topics in an easy and digestible manner will help people overcome these barriers and feel empowered to take control of their wealth, whether it’s through real estate, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.

In this article, I’ll dive into some of the strategies and methods I used to help gain knowledge and insight when investing in the stock market. Keep in mind this is not the definitive guide, but it’s steps that I took to help me become more financially literate about the stock market. Everyone’s path to financial education is different and unique and this is only meant to provide a different perspective for someone just starting out.

**Pay Attention to the World Around You**

The first thing I usually tell people is, start to observe the world around you and the businesses that are close to your network. You’ll easily be able to find many companies if you start to shift your mindset and look at how the world functions.

First, look at what kind of products or services you consume. Do you need to get your fix of vanilla latte at Starbucks ($SBUX) in the morning? More of a fast food person? Let’s look at McDonalds ($MCD), Chipotle ($CMG), Shake Shack ($SHAK), or Restaurant Brands International ($QSR). Are you a hardcore gamer? Well, I’m sure one of your games or consoles comes from Sony ($SNE), Nintendo ($NTDOY), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO), or Microsoft ($MSFT). Or maybe you’ve been working from home? I’m sure you’ve had to buy some products from Amazon ($AMZN) or Wayfair ($W) to spruce up your office space. You’re probably also using things like Zoom ($ZM), Google Drive ($GOOG or $GOOGL), or Slack to keep yourself productive during the day.

**Build a Watchlist**

Now that we’ve got the brain working a little, it’s important to start building a watchlist of all the stocks you’ve thought of. You can use your broker watchlist tool, or even an app like Yahoo Finance, WeBull, etc. Sort them in a way that works for you, whether it’s by sector (financial, tech, industrials), subsector (gaming, oil, e-commerce), or even by priority (Watchlist Tier 1, Watchlist Tier 2, etc.)

Organization is key when building your watchlist. You’ll want to have them organized because it’ll help you get a quick glance of what’s happening in the market at any given time. By checking on the stocks you’ve added to your watchlist periodically, you’ll learn how they move according to catalysts (market news, earnings, etc) and be able to plan how and when you’d like to invest in them.

**Search within an Index Fund or ETF**

A great way to search up companies is by looking at current index fund or ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) allocations. With index funds, you can look at the holdings of the S&P500 (Top 500 American companies) or the Nasdaq 100 (Most active, largest 100 Nasdaq companies). At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of the S&P500 are:

1. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)
2. Microsoft Corp ($MSFT)
3. Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN)
4. Facebook, Inc. ($FB)
5. Alphabet Inc. Class A ($GOOGL)
6. Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG)
7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc ($BRK.B)
8. JPMorgan Chase & Co. ($JPM)
9. Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA)
10. Johnson & Johnson ($JNJ)

Another way is to look into the holdings of an ETF. There are tons of ETFs out there that track indices like $SPY and $QQQ, which track the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, as well as more focused sector ETFs, like the ARK Innovation Fund ($ARKK) or the O’Shares Global Internet Giants Fund ($OGIG).

One of my favorites is ARKK, as they focus on disruptive innovation and change. So, for example, if something like this was to resonate with you, looking into their top holdings will give you some insight on what kinds of companies you’d need to do research on to gain exposure to this particular strategy. At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of ARKK are:

1. Tesla, Inc ($TSLA)
2. Teladoc Health, Inc. ($TDOC)
3. Roku, Inc. ($ROKU)
4. Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)
5. Square, Inc. ($SQ)
6. Shopify, Inc ($SHOP)
7. Spotify Technology SA ($SPOT)
8. Twilio, Inc (TWLO)
9. Coinbase Global, Inc ($COIN)
10. Unity Software, Inc ($U)

Hopefully looking into index funds or ETFs like the ones listed above help spark curiosity and the urge to build on your own knowledge!

**Invest in Things You Understand (Personal, Business)**

Another piece of advice I like to give people is to only invest in areas of the market you understand. For example, if I see a sector like biotech or cybersecurity shoot up 50% in the last three months, but I don’t really understand how this industry works, don’t put your money in it. Simple as that. If the whole stock market started to fall, these will be the easiest to target as a potential sell because you don’t understand the industry or the company at all. Your conviction on the stock is low so incentive to hold onto it for the long term is also low.

For me, I’m a big gamer and I understand the industry well. To compare it to the previous example above, I can take those companies and further extrapolate to build upon my research using my existing knowledge. As a result, I’m aware that gaming consoles use chips from Intel ($INTC), Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), as well as GPU processors from Nvidia ($NVDA). Many video games are developed on software applications like Unity ($U). I’m also aware that a large population of gamers and gaming companies come from Asia and Europe, therefore I can look into stocks like Ubisoft ($UBI), Capcom ($CCOEF), or even Tencent Holdings ($TCEHY). What about gaming accessories from Corsair ($CRSR) or Logitech ($LOGI)? And let’s not forget about Gamestop ($GME)!

Another great way to leverage your knowledge is to look at your workplace and how the business is structured from within. Does your company utilize products or services from other companies? If you work at a software company, perhaps you use Cisco ($CSCO) or Ciena ($CIEN) for your networking. If your company uses customer or sales support, you may be using something like Salesforce ($CRM), Twilio ($TWLO), or Zendesk ($ZEN). To optimize your business, your company may also be leveraging cybersecurity services like Palo Alto ($PALO), Okta ($OKTA), or Crowdstrike ($CRWD). By looking within your own workplace, you’ll be able to do a bit of deeper digging to find stocks that services businesses and aren’t as customer facing.

Understanding an industry well allows you to build your conviction in that industry. By fully grasping the ins and outs, you’ll know exactly what you’re invested in. This prevents panicking or selling if you suddenly see a red day, because you know what the company is fundamentally and potentially capable of. It also allows you to get invested in the companies you’re buying, ultimately feeling like a small owner of the company, which is exactly what the function of stocks are.

**Diversify your Portfolio**

So now, you’ve done a bit of research and found a ton of stocks you might potentially invest in. Now what? Well, now is where you want to think about risk management and portfolio diversity.

From Investopedia, diversification is a “risk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.”

How do I know what’s diversified enough? Great question, but that’s up to your personal risk tolerance. Try not to allocate all your stocks into one single sector or area of the market. By broadening out in sector (tech, industrial), subsector (5G, banks), geography (US, Asia, Europe), market cap (large, medium, small), and more, you can feel comfortable and confident with your investments. The last thing you want to be doing is checking your stocks every minute and wondering if you should buy more or sell it off. Also consider the timeline of your allocations. The majority of my portfolio is in long-term investments (3+ years), but I do have a small portion of my portfolio allocated to mid-term and momentum investments (less than two years), such as options and swing trading. It’s up to each individual investor to determine these allocations and stay committed to knowing when to change your allocation based on your time horizon.

Consider this portfolio of $10000 dollars: (Stock, dollar amount\[%\], sector/subsector/geography/market cap)

* Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA - $1000 (10%) - Tech / EV / USA / Large
* Alibaba Group ($BABA) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / E-Commerce / ASIA / Large
* Bank of America ($BAC) - $1000 (10%) - Financials / Banking / USA / Large
* GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Pharma / EU / Large
* Brookfield Renewable ($BEP)- $1000 (10%) - Energy / Renewable / CAN / Large
* Papa John’s Int. ($PZZA)- $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Consumer/ USA / Mid
* Ubisoft Entertainment ($UBI) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / Gaming / EU / Mid
* Barrick Gold ($GOLD) - $1000 (10%) - Industrials / Mining / CAN / Mid
* Aurora Cannabis ($ACB) - $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Cannabis / CAN / Small
* Nano-X Imaging ($NNOX) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Telehealth / Israel / Small

As you can see, we’ve been able to allocate into many different sectors, subsectors, geographies, and market caps. If one of these companies were to disappear tomorrow, we’d still have 90% of our portfolio remaining.

Of our mock portfolio, our sector allocation is the following: 30% Technology, 20% Consumer, 20% Health, and 10% each in Financials, Energy, and Industrials. Our subsector allocation is fully diversified in 10 subsectors of the market: Electric Vehicles, E-Commerce, Banking, Pharma, Renewable Energy, Consumer, Gaming, Mining, Cannabis, and Telehealth. In terms of geography, our allocation is the following: 30% USA, 30% Canada, 20% Europe, 10% Asia, and 10% Israel. With our market cap, our allocation is the following: 50% large, 30% mid, and 20% small. As you can see, this portfolio is well diversified in terms of sector, subsector, region, and market cap. These allocations will ultimately be up to you, as you will be in control of your portfolio.

**Now You’re Ready!**

And that’s it, we’ve learned how to find stocks by looking at your surroundings using your own knowledge from your personal and work life and now you understand how to properly diversify a portfolio based on your own risk tolerance and time horizon.

comment,i57bklx,stockstobuytoday,"Are you prepared to take on the markets this week? If not, here is a watchlist that I created of some potential catalysts I’ll be watching for the week beginning April 18th.",TheAnonymousProfit,,5,"Earnings season is in full swing, and the spotlight turns to an array of blue-chip companies across multiple sectors. Despite the numerous upcoming earnings reports, Elon Musk's pursuit of Twitter (TWTR) could still be the top watch this week, with new twists anticipated after the company responded to his hostile takeover bid with a “poison pill” strategy. Some analysts believe that Twitter is unlikely to recapture its all-time-high of $80.75 per share from last year, and that a deal with Musk or another buyer may be the best strategy. 

As jam packed as this week may be, the biggest driver of the overall market will likely be the continued pessimism of interest rates, inflation and war in Europe. Analysts will be sifting through company commentaries to see how all of these things are impacting the bottom line. Forward guidance could continue to be poor. Companies are going to whine and complain about cost pressures, even when they’re going to report improved results. So that may cause price action to be a little sloppier.

Hopefully this graphic can help you navigate your investing and trading decisions. Save this post for reference and let me know what’s on your watchlist in the comments. Good luck with your trading!"

•BURUD - To resume trading on NYSE American Friday 08/02. Right now it’s in the OTC but they won their delisting appeal to trade back on the NYSE. This one feels like a no brainer the chart has a massive gap to fill. Current market cap $2.5M with a patent portfolio valued at $100M.

•ABQQ another really good one. Licensing deal announced yesterday. They basically made half of their quarterly revenue in that PR alone. They have really good financials for a trip I must add. They just reached net profitability last quarter and they have pretty good revenue growth and healthy balance sheet. They have an online movie streaming platform. It has a hybrid paid subscription model similar to Netflix and also an advertising model like ROKU, and TUBI. They’re in a special niche with low competition which is foreign movies. They also have brick and mortar walk in Movie Theater business in New York with plans on expanding nationwide. Another source of revenue is licensing the movies that they have rights to for distribution.

comment,hlbcwy6,stockstobuytoday,What do you guys think of my portfolio!,Smooth_Consequence_1,,2,"Okay so what you want to do is pick great companies that we use on a daily basis, as a nice core. Look through the s&p 500 and pick the best companies. Go to stockanalyzer.com & search for that stock. Click “financials” and go to revenue. Look at see if their revenue is increasing every year. For example, look at Microsoft & amazons growth. That’s the type of growth you want. 

Look at the net profit also. Make sure it doesn’t have a negative sign, meaning that the company loses money aka they aren’t profitable. 

After you’ve found great companies, you want to look at the chart of that stock. Do not buy a stock at its all time high. Wait for a nice pullback and buy it. Do not be afraid of days where the market is red. That is a buying opportunity if you have great companies.

post,10c1ane,stockstobuytoday,Universal cancer vaccine with very promising effect! (Multi-bagger potential),Ultimovacs4ever,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/10c1ane/universal_cancer_vaccine_with_very_promising/,17,"Imagine a world where cancer treatment is revolutionized by a single breakthrough discovery - a universal cancer vaccine with incredibly promising results. This revolutionary new vaccine has the potential to improve outcomes in all immunotherapies and offer long-lasting effects without the need for screening. Not only that, but it also boasts a good safety profile, is ready to use off the shelf, and easy to administer.

**Are you ready to dive into the details of this groundbreaking discovery? Keep reading to find out more.**

The potential for a new and innovative cancer treatment could be just around the corner, as Ultimovacs conducts a revolutionary clinical trial, INITIUM, across the United States and Europe. This Phase II randomized trial is evaluating the use of a cancer vaccine called UV1 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) ipilimumab and nivolumab for the treatment of first-line metastatic malignant melanoma. The trial design is event-driven, meaning that the primary endpoint will be reached when a certain number of events, such as disease progression or death, have occurred. Specifically, the trial will reach its endpoint when 70 progression-free survival (PFS) events have been recorded.

With 156 patients already enrolled in the INITIUM trial, who are randomly assigned to receive either the combination treatment or CPIs alone, Ultimovacs has been providing regular updates on the enrolment status to investors. Though the company has not explicitly stated the hypothesis being tested, it is believed to be a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.60, which would correspond to 41 events in the control arm and 29 in the experimental arm.

There are two large historical trials in malignant melanoma that can be used as controls for INITIUM: Checkmate-067 and Checkmate-511. Both of these trials had the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as INITIUM, so it is reasonable to expect similar PFS event rates in the control arm of INITIUM. Using the recruitment curve and the PFS curves from Checkmate-067 and Checkmate-511, it is possible to estimate the number of events that are likely to have occurred in the control arm of INITIUM. If the control arm in INITIUM progresses at the same rate as in Checkmate-067, the primary endpoint will be reached at the end of this month. If the INITIUM study can be more accurately compared to the Checkmate-511 study, the results may even meet the requirements for accelerated approval within a few weeks.

Here is an overview that illustrates the progress compared to CM-067. The chart shows that assuming there are 70 events today, there is a higher likelihood of achieving a significant outcome (i.e. a minimum of 41 events).

The next graph illustrates the development compared to CM-511 and CM-067. The chart shows that the estimated chances of achieving a significant outcome using CM-511 and CM-067 as a reference, assuming today's readings, range between 77% and 53%, and the probability that UV1 has no effect is between 2%-8%.

Overall, the combination of an event-driven design, detailed enrolment information, and large and valid historical controls creates unique opportunities for investors in Ultimovacs and its clinical trial INITIUM. The cancer vaccine UV1 has the potential to be effective in a wide range of cancers due to its targeting of cells expressing the enzyme telomerase, which is necessary for the survival and growth of 85-90% of cancers. If the results of the trial are positive, it could be a significant advancement in the treatment of malignant melanoma and other types of cancer.

**A significant opportunity exists here that the market has yet to realize.** 

Ultimovacs, the Norwegian biotechnology company developing the universal cancer vaccine UV1, is publicly listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in Norway under the ticker symbol ULTI. The company's current market capitalization is 391,819,791 USD.

**If you have any questions about Ultimovacs or UV1, feel free to ask them in the comment section, and I will try to answer them to the best of my ability.**

comment,j4dhzui,stockstobuytoday,Universal cancer vaccine with very promising effect! (Multi-bagger potential),Ultimovacs4ever,,0,"Thank you for your response. 

If you are interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the company, I recommend reviewing the company presentation available on the company's website ([https://ultimovacs.com/content/2022/12/20221214-Ultimovacs-Company-Presentation.pdf](https://ultimovacs.com/content/2022/12/20221214-Ultimovacs-Company-Presentation.pdf)).

This document provides a wealth of valuable information pertaining to the company's activities and operations. The company is currently conducting clinical studies utilizing a number of leading immunotherapies. Should the vaccine demonstrate the level of efficacy we anticipate in the INITIUM study, there is a likelihood of significant interest from major pharmaceutical companies."

comment,m6m5tzg,stockstobuytoday,GCTK ,TapFeisty4675,,1,"i'm not sure.  I've been doing a lot of research on this stock. I can't really explain why it is \*THIS\* low.  Yeah the finacials aren't great but they had a 10m public offering with the drop in november right on the earnings date. it actually covered their debts and losses. on top of what looks like big money getting involved, kind of tells me something is going on. There's a couple times the stock started to tick up and then a massive volume spike nuked it. 

I'm not really sure what to predict the price at. it could go down again, could go to .5 or to a dollar or higher. I almost get GME levels of shorting feeling going on with it.  the volume to float to price are just not making sense without mass shorting being the explanation. I feel like this stock should be easily in the just under a dollar range naturally, which is where it was at the last split. To me, this is one to watch, for sure. I got in yesterday. The stock just does not seem to be even close to what it should be at in my view."

comment,m6ly2fq,stockstobuytoday,GCTK ,jigsawmark123,,2,Hopefully they announce something really HUGE
comment,m6mnzbs,stockstobuytoday,GCTK ,TapFeisty4675,,2,"this stock has a history of pretty aggressive break outs. from 1 dollar to 16 in a single run.  so 1.5 seems reasonable. however i might hold and risk a lower payout to see if it breaks higher.  with that 196m volume, if it's mainly a short, there's two things I could see happening, the shorts buy out and it goes crazy high or the more likely, the shorts double down to hold down the bull run. 

with that recent sabby investment, I kind of wonder if it's being manipulated to lower lows to let them buy up cheaper stock before it breaks out. I can't see this thing falling to zero with the investors they have. it seems artificially low right now. I'll happily take 5k shares at 1 dollar if nothing else, but part of me is hopeful that this is a big one, i'm talking 5+"
comment,m6m3jb8,stockstobuytoday,GCTK ,TapFeisty4675,,3,"well they started human trials. they could start sharing more info soon. I don't think tuesday soon, but considering their stock price at the moment, they could very well give a no news type of response of ""we started our trials and they're so far the data is exceeding our expectations""

I'm a nurse, so I have a little different perspective on GCTK beyond the squeeze I think will happen. I'm pretty sure I'm going to sit in this one long (after the squeeze, i like money) The Device itself would be a big deal for patients, since it's implanted like a pacemaker. So if longevity and accuracy really is on point, it would be a big thing for diabetics. None of the tech is solely new either, the sum of its parts are but CGMs have been around for a while and implants similar to this are not new either. 

Patients have to inject themselves with a sensor on current tech. so this would be a boon in the consumer market. The only downside I see is long term, if it lasts for 2  to 3 years, will it need replaced and what would that look like for patients? First gen tech, so I expect the longevity to go further. This stock is a stock I believe in, BUT I also am aware of the financials surrounding the company are not great. They're a stock I'm staying in but dipping out when dilution and splits occur because of how volatile that would be. 

Right now though, something is  weird with the stock. the volume relative to what it normally sees is crazy high with next to no movement. it's been like that for a while, even in the face of good news.  With a 9m float, a 200m volume of trading should see \*something\* to reflect it, not a 2 cent change."

comment,hhjydqr,stockstobuytoday,What about $SDC?!🤔Anybody have any advice on this stock? I’m trying to buy some shares at a SP of $5.50!,july4boygolfer,,4,"Tomorrow morning it will likely shoot up then go down or go down then rise back up. I mean if you can get it at 5.50 tomorrow that's great, but I'd be surprised if it gets that low. Getting in now at this price or anywhere near it is good value regardless of whether or not this squeezes. Safe low risk play as its trading near 52 week low and well below one year price target with a very real potential to go on a squeeze run. My recommendation if you are new to investing is to acquire the shares over a week or so and buy the dips. Buying an entire position all once is only the move when the stock is already shooting to the moon. The best way to guarantee the lowest entry price is to acquire slowly and  average down. If the stock takes off, then go all in, you wont miss much if it does, because if blastoff day is soon then this squeeze is going to be much bigger than any of us originally imagined. More than likely we will see an ebb and flow up and down with a general upward trend until earnings. I suspect this to take off then. Hope this was useful."

A correction is the label given to a smaller dip as opposed to a recession, corrections are not inevitable, they’re not a necessary part of the market cycle. They’re labels given after the fact. This could very well end up being labeled a recession, but until we know the broader picture we treat it as a correction.

It’s also impossible to deny that trump and his different signaling on economic policy, along with curtailing the federal governments workforce is a primary driver of the drop. Tariffs are bad and recent GDP projections dropping due to trumps economic are a huge red flag for the market. Likewise the fact that he’s walked back and delayed big policy events makes markets even less sure where money should be placed. A good president/admin can beat back a recession, Biden did that into a soft landing last term. The price was the inflation which likely saved the economy.

CVKD is also collaborating with Abbott for Phase 3 clinical trials which is huge. Abbott is a $200 billion dollar company. Also worth noting CVKD was granted FDA fast track designation and orphan drug status for Tecarfarin.

Unmet need & market opportunity for CVKD’s Tecarfarin ($2B annually)

They have a pretty low cash burn between $1M-2M per quarter and they currently have $11.3M cash based on their PR last month on November 7

Also their management team and board of directors has a stacked resume and amazing track records. Not too many investors know about the stock but it’s starting to get picked up. They actually gotten 2 analysts ratings last month so it’s possible we see some additional analyst coverage.

Overall it looks like an amazing play especially at the current levels it’s trading at."

post,12gku7j,stockstobuytoday,Discussion of Steakholder Food's $STKH Annual Financials,EagleEyeStx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/12gku7j/discussion_of_steakholder_foods_stkh_annual/,13,"Last week Steakholder Foods (NASDAQ: STKH) released its annual financial report for 2022. This is a company and sector I’ve been watching for some time now, and over the holiday weekend took the chance to really review the statement and management commentary carefully. After reviewing the data, I remain long on STKH given its significant first-comers advantage in R&D for the key technological infrastructure critical for scaling cellular agriculture for mass consumption globally. Here’s why:

First off, lets start with the obvious. STKH is a pre-revenue company, and 2022 was most certainly not profitable for the company. The lion’s share of their expenses ($9.8M or +29% YoY) went to funding ongoing R&D, accounts for roughly ⅓ of net losses. In contrast, the company did manage to trim its general & administrative expenses by 13%. Regardless, STKH burned through a lot of cash in 2022, which was probably one of the chief reasons they undertook the December ‘22/January ‘23 public round that brought share price to its current range under $1. While this bottom line is not attractive on a short-term horizon, I’ve been adding to my position over recent months given STKH’s average PT of $5.50PT, meaning we’re looking at potential upside of 800%.

https://preview.redd.it/7c00k2wjavsa1.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=357e185f86d9b40c0d69773a72aadf88af9efd86

The management commentary accompanying last week’s financials helped put the company’s current position into perspective. A summary of the key points include:

**Strategic Collabs**

* Collaboration with Singapore’s Umami Meats to penetrate APAC markets with 3D structured, cultivated seafood products.
* Received a $1 million grant for R&D of structured cultivated fish products from Singapore-Israel Industrial R&D Foundation.
* Raised $13 million in two rounds of public offerings ($6.5 million in June 2022 and $6.5 million in January 2023) to fund ongoing research.
* Recently participated in a strategic investment round in Wilk Technologies Ltd. (TASE: WILK) alongside Danone and the Central Bottling Co. Ltd., aimed at advancing the sustainable food solutions landscape worldwide.

**Technological Breakthroughs:**

* Its development of a proprietary 3D bio-printer led to the introduction of Omakase Beef Morsels, a highly marbled, 3D-printed cultivated beef cut.
* STKH’s yield of cell production was boosted by a factor of 50 by leveraging a new filtration system method.
* Demonstrated that cultivated muscle cells have the same nutritional value as beef.
* Developed a temperature-controlled print bed for its industrial-scale printer, a significant step towards mass production for the global market.

**Commercialization Strategy**

* Announced an ambitious accelerated go-to-market strategy for 2023.
* Completed a strategic rebrand to reflect its commitment to cultivating a new community of meat lovers who will participate in the company's mission to make high-quality real meat sustainably.
* Closed its wholly-owned subsidiary, Peace of Meat BV (PoM), as a means to optimize its funds and investment strategy.

**A Growing Intellectual Property Portfolio:**

* Granted its first patent for the physical manipulation of cultured muscle tissue, in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
* Has a portfolio of patent applications awaiting approval, including a provisional patent application for mimicking the texture of cooked fish.
* Received its first registered trademark in Japan.

https://preview.redd.it/sqncalokbvsa1.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=801fcb472c9543d1943b136410bcd5cbdf52ed19

The way that I see, STKH is carefully laying the groundwork to dominate the intellectual property that will be a must-have for other players hoping to enter the cultivated meat market. Despite their negative bottom line, the value of intangible assets represented by STKH’s first-comers advantage in the cellAg space is priceless. Though cash flow may be tight over the coming months, I remain unequivocally bullish on Steakholder’s long-term potential to be THE dominant player in the future of food technology. LONG."

comment,gr2k258,stockstobuytoday,KMPH the next GME? #SaveTheKids,Chefserge,,2,As close to a de-risked investment as possible. The only question has been the timeline for the SP to reflect the actual value of the company. I got in with $70k at approx. $10/average. I’m not interested in selling until at least a year out for tax implications but the past few hours have been entertaining nonetheless. As opposed to other companies that are trading way beyond their technical analysis shows - KMPH is undervalued and is a great bargain for any price below $20.

*Record Revenue increasing 5 straight Quarters

*30% SI, poised for a massive squeeze on a small cap. There is no bear thesis anymore

*Major partnership with key OEM’s (now Toyota in addition to GM, Honda, Ford, Rivian 33 all together)-

*There was a NYT article where a VP of EVGO mentioned that red states are actually some of their biggest partners as they see it as inevitable: 

“Sara Rafalson, a vice president at EVgo, a Los Angeles-based charging company that has built chargers in over 35 states, said that the company was seeing its biggest demand growth in Republican-led states like Texas and Florida.”

*EV winter is ending with GM EV Equinox launch June 17th + Costco Discount + EV Blazer Cost Reduction + Stellantis $25K Jeep + many other cheap EV’s 2nd half of this year under, Hertz firesale of EV’s under $25K + $4500 to $7500 incentive

*CEO Insider buy of 125,000 shares 

*Lower interest rates in September combined with many new cheap electric vehicle models like GM Equinox Compact

*Low Debt

*Rolling out North American Charging Standard NACS to entire country so ALL vehicles can recharge at Charging stations

*1,000,000 customers doubling annually (at least, likely more)

*Artificial Intelligence to place charging stations for maximum Charging Revenue

*Renew program to upgrade older stations

*100% USA parts compliant so not affected by China Tariffs and will take business from others

*The US must upgrade its EV infrastructure if they want to compete globally. EVGO is the only fast chargers. BLNK and CHPT only give you one time sales revenue whereas EVGO gives you multiple.

*TESLA backing off of electric vehicle Charging leaves even more room to grow. EVGO is next best at L3 Chargers

*EBIDTA forecast to be positive in early 2025 if not sooner

*Will NOT have to do a secondary offering - line of credit in case, high growth and cash reserves, may not even need it.

*Rates are getting cut soon leading to more growth 

*They expect a DOE loan this year 

*trading sideways right now, perfect entry before the next leg up. Last spike up took 1 month and 1 week of sideways trading. Based off the same timeline, we are a week off. 

*They are adding high end talent, big names from Tesla. Recently hired a CPO, Chief Peoples Officer implying they are expecting to expand rapidly thus need someone with strong connections in the space."

If youre only risking 1% on a small account you're not gonna get very far. 
You can't continue risking that much tho or the odds will catch up to you.

post,y70vkr,stockstobuytoday,Deconstructing Valuation Metrics In The Cybersecurity Sector,darrenfox59,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/y70vkr/deconstructing_valuation_metrics_in_the/,12,"2022 has set a particularly tough macro environment for even the best performing tech stocks. From peaking inflation, which has tightened investors’ wallets, to rising interest rates that limit investments in risky avenues such as up-and-coming tech stocks, the tech sector’s performance has been largely underwhelming. Geopolitical tensions caused by the Ukraine-Russia war and global supply chain disruptions due to China lockdowns have further slowed down its performance.

The Nasdaq Composite Index, one of the most widely followed indexes in the world, weighs heavily in the tech stocks to watch. In the second quarter of 2022 the index reported a loss of 22.4%, its worst quarterly performance since 2008. Compared to its all-time high from November 2021, the index corrected over 30% in value YTD. Over the last 7 days, the Tech industry has dropped 4.0%, driven by a pullback from Microsoft of 2.4%. However, the industry is down 32% over the past year. As for the next few years, earnings are expected to grow by 13% per annum. 

Investors are however optimistic about certain dynamic players in the cybersecurity sector, despite the downturns in the broader market. Cybersecurity spending has soared since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Organizations have been faced with new security challenges as cloud computing and remote work have become essential. As a result, many cybersecurity stocks were top performers in 2020 and 2021, boosted by strong demand for next-gen security software. A bear market in 2022 put a damper on some of the highest flyers, but cybersecurity remains a top investment theme.

According to the Identity Theft Resource Center, the number of data breaches set a new record in 2021, with the number of incidents jumping 68% from 2020 and up 23% from the previous high in 2017. Data breaches were up another 14% year-over-year during the first quarter of 2022. Overall, cybercrime is on the rise at a double-digit percentage pace. 

It shouldn’t be surprising that global spending on cybersecurity is expected to exceed $170 billion in 2022 (up about 13% from 2021) and will likely continue to be a high-growth industry for years. Cybersecurity stocks are a red-hot niche of the tech industry, so knowing how to invest in them can yield some big returns in the decade ahead.

Established in 2010 and situated in Clearwater, Florida With a selection of apps including films, games, interactive modules, and more, KnowBe4 offers simulated phishing attacks through the browser. It's crucial to teach employees how to recognize attacks in order to remove the ""human error"" component from a company's attack surface. After receiving more than $300 million in venture capital funding, the business went public in 2021, but since then, the performance of its shares has been a little lackluster, with the price of each share circling about the $20 level (give or take). At a 16X revenue multiple, Vista Equity Partners acquired the company (rev of 290M sold for 4.3 bn). Vista Equity Partners’ offer of $24.90 per share represents a premium of around 44% on KnowBe4’s $17 closing price on September 16, the date at which Vista first made its proposed bid.

HUB Security is a cybersecurity firm that focuses on cutting-edge solutions for safeguarding private and public data. The business unveiled an innovative set of data theft prevention technologies together with an advanced encrypted computing solution designed to thwart hostile hardware intrusions. HUB operates in more than 30 nations and offers a broad spectrum of cybersecurity services in addition to cutting-edge cybersecurity computing products. Similar to KnowBe4, HUB is also set to list on the NASDAQ thanks to the SPAC merger RNER. They are valued at seven times their revenue for their Nasdaq listing as well. With the 16X multiple we saw above for KnowBe4's evaluation, HUB has already stated that they anticipate 115 million in revenue this year. This values them at $1.8 billion.

Currently, they are valued on the TASE at about 670 million ILS, or about 190 million USD in market capitalization. Their SPAC to the NASDAQ is valued at USD 1.25 billion, which is still far less than the 16X multiple. Additionally, this doesn't even take into account the 500 million USD worth of contracts they have signed for the upcoming few years. Which would easily put them at a $3 billion valuation. Because of this, HUB is positioned to grow and is, at the very least, undervalued.

During this bear market, economic worries were a key issue in the technology sector as businesses warned against slowing down spending on advertisements, gadgets, e-commerce, and software. But despite rising interest rates and inflation that has remained close to a 40-year high, demand for cybersecurity services continues to soar. As can be seen, the two outstanding companies in the space are HUB and knowBe4, both of which are undervalued and brimming with promise. Any wise investor keeping an eye on these two should be looking for substantial returns in the near future."

post,rpiynj,stockstobuytoday,Cyber/Tech Plays ($NET $RDWR $HUB) Innovating Much-Needed DDoS Solutions,OldBay_Trader,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/rpiynj/cybertech_plays_net_rdwr_hub_innovating/,13,"**What is a DDoS attack?**

One of the most popular strikes against this industry is DDoS attacks. A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, as the name implies, is a denial of service (DoS) attack that originates from multiple sources simultaneously. A DoS attack is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users. This is accomplished by flooding the target with traffic, or sending it information that triggers a crash making the targeted system unresponsive.

The most common DoS attacks are Buffer Overflow attacks - sending more traffic to a network address than the programmers have bult the system to handle. It includes most attack types, in addition to others that are designed to exploit bugs specific to certain applications or networks. By saturating a targeted server with an overwhelming amount of packets, a malicious actor is able to oversaturate server capacity, resulting in denial-of-service. In order for most DoS flood attacks to be successful, the malicious actor must have more available bandwidth than the target. An attack type in which a memory buffer overflow can cause a machine to consume all available hard disk space, memory, or CPU time. This form of exploit often results in sluggish behavior, system crashes, or other deleterious server behaviors, resulting in denial-of-service.

In the early days of the Internet, websites would exist on individual hosts, and single-source DoS attacks could be effective. Today, this is much less likely; sites are hosted on the cloud and/or across multiple data centers, integrated with CDNs, and so on. Even using techniques such as amplification and reflection, it is very difficult for a single-source attack to have enough bandwidth to overwhelm a modern site’s resources.

**Why it’s hard to defend against DDoS attacks**

Modern security technologies have developed mechanisms to defend against most forms of DoS attacks, but due to the unique characteristics of DDoS, it is still regarded as an elevated threat and is of higher concern to organizations that fear being targeted by such an attack. DDoS attack occurs when multiple systems orchestrate a synchronized DoS attack to a single target. The essential difference is that instead of being attacked from one location, the target is attacked from many locations at once.

**Companies Developing DDoS Solutions for the Financial Sector**

Now that we’ve unpacked what a DDoS attack is and why banks/fintech companies are such a prime target, lets take a look at some of the players developing cutting-edge solutions for future protection:

**CloudFlare (NYSE: NET)** is a leader in the field of web architecture/security with a specialty on DDoS mitigation. The firm went public in September 2019 at a share price of $18. Its stock price has steadily climbed since the IPO, continuing its uptick at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as consumers and companies increasingly turned online. According to recent reviews by both IDC MarketSpace and Forrester, CloudFare has been recognized as an innovator in the field of DDoS prevention and mitigation. CloudFare offers one of the most comprehensive DDoS prevention toolkits on the market, and it is compatible with web applications, network infrastructure, and the IoT. NET is a pretty solid tech investment pick, with a consensus rating of BUY and an average target price of $205 (up from $137). In other words, this is an established player in the cyber solutions market with a reputation that precedes itself and forecasts for strong upside moving into 2022.

**RadWare (NASDAQ: RDWR)** is another household name in the world of net/data security. This Israeli-American company has created a niche for itself in the space of cyber security and application delivery solutions for applications in physical, virtual, cloud, and software defined data centers worldwide. One of their flagship products is DefensePro, which provides automated DDoS protection from fast-moving, high-volume, encrypted or very-short-duration threats. RadWare has been workin with leading players in the financial services and banking industries for nearly a decade, and its DefensePro is considered a “gold standard” for anti-DDoS solutions. Notwithstanding a recent downgrade from overperforming to performing by Oppenheimer, RDWR holds a BUY consensus after gaining nearly 30% in share value over the past month alone. Definitely another DDoS prevention provider to keep tabs on.

**HUB Security (TASE: HUB)** is an Israeli player that has surged in 2021. From their merger with ALD in February to their $22M acquisition of ComSec global in September to their recent declaration of intent for a NASDAQ listing, HUB is fast becoming a disruptor in the confidential computing field. They recently clinched deals with three European national banks for a DDoS simulation platform designed to up readiness and defensive protocol. More specifically, their D.Storm product is a system that collects data from the bot attacks in real-time and presents it to the user for in-depth analysis. In essence, D.Storm provides actionable intelligence to banks and fintech actors that they need to manage the risks in the face of an increasingly sophisticated threat landscape. Though listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, HUB is on my watchlist for the anticipated NASDAQ listing and the significant value-multiplier it will entail for HUB’s enterprise value.

This went on a bit longer than expected, but I hope readers who made it to the bottom have a better idea of what a DDoS attack is, why they are particularly worrisome for the financial services sector, and who some of the big names working on mitigation solutions are.

Through a tech enhancement and value-added acquisition, Nano Dimension is pioneering an exciting growth market. Investors can either watch from the sidelines or position themselves to capitalize on this multi-year opportunity.

If there was ever a ground-floor market growth opportunity, the 3D printing market would be it. According to Decisive Market Insights, the global 3D printed electronics market is projected to reach a whopping $21.8 billion by the year 2026.

Without a doubt, Nano Dimension is preparing to innovate and even dominate in this expanding field. As evidence of this, Nano Dimension introduced its next-generation DragonFly LDM 2.0 system. This is top-tier technology for 3D printing enthusiasts and businesses alike.

BMEA & LOVE are two tickers to check out, as they are on the verge of a potential squeeze. BMEA has a current short float around 50% and LOVE has a short float around 30%. Both are also under even min PT's

NKLA is speculative.. but with a short float above 25%, currently on Reg sho list, a market cap below 100K, and analyst PT's well above the current $1 share price (ave PT is $14)... NKLA could see a big rally run as ppl start to cover due to nuclear gaining a lot of interest across the board.

$CTM 593%

$KULR 547%

$AMPG 543% and the list goes on

  
ARTW meets criteria to do something very similar. It being the only low float stock in the agriculture sector trading viciously under book value, and being cash flow positive I think this could be the next multi bagger move like the rest listed above. 

This stock has a credit facility and no r/s history making it a safe bet with minimal dilution worries. They are looking fund organic growth and not raise additional capital.

Its peers all make over 1b in revenues while this small stock makes 30m in revenues and has a tiny undervalued 12m market cap. This could be the next stock to move from the low $2s to the teens. "

So she has me going with her to the store and picking up the most obscure things. Sometimes they are good and some not so good. She recently had me pick up this environmentally friendly cardboard packed water called Flow water. To be honest it was a little more expensive than traditional water but it really was good (i'm a big water drinker) and if it's better for the environment that's just a bonus. But I started to think of the price vs the cost to make.

So I looked into the company more and found out they were traded publicly on the TSX. Curiosity got the better of me as I started looking into their PR’s and saw they had massive revenue increases as well as a recent partnership with Live Nation. But I concluded they were making a ton of money and definitely tasted a lot better than Dasani or Aquafina.

I haven’t told my new girl because she got me hooked on this stuff and I kept making fun of her for drinking water out of a box. If you guys know of any other unique grocery store items we should try let me know as I want to be able to get her hooked on something haha, thanks."

**Workhorse Group. (WKHS)** can be found in a similar setup to the **Volkswagen (VWAGY)** Short Squeeze of ‘08.

For those of you who don’t know, **Volkswagen (VWAGY)** had one of the largest, most costly, and unforeseeable short squeezes in history. From a starting price of **€210.85 ($249.83)** to **€1005 ($1,190.69)** in less than two days, briefly making it the most valuable company in the world...

Now let’s try to enhance this perspective, in 2008 we were in the midst of what was known as *The Great Recession.* The worst financial disaster since *The Great Depression.* The World Equity Markets were in a progressively worsening situation across 2008. For example, two of the largest single day percentage drops in the **S&P 500 INDEX** were in 2008. **1)** *10/15/08*: -9.04% **2)** *12/01/08:* \-8.93%.

In 2008 the auto industry as a whole was in a rough state because it is a *Cyclical Stock,* so it moves depending on economic confidence. So, when the state of the economy is “good” it goes up, when the state of the economy is “bad” it generally goes down. Of course, in a financial crisis people are not buying cars because they have to be conservative with their money and put food on the table knowing there is so much uncertainty within the economy. With this consistent drop of the auto industry, it turned big auto companies in the world that are on every stock exchange into sexy, attractive short candidates. With that being said, of course **Volkswagen** was one of those candidates. 

**Volkswagen** at the time, was in some pretty serious debt, but consistently reported quarterly growth. With consistent earnings in a troubling time, **Volkswagen** managed to keep the stock price around **€300 ($355).**

*Ten years ago, amidst the worst financial crises since the Great Depression, the American auto industry almost died. By Fall 2008, the “Big Three” US car companies of General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford faced potential insolvency, and without swift government intervention, their futures were in doubt.* \- **Business Insider**

**General Motors (GM)** was the biggest automaker in the world for about 72 years which they then had to file for bankruptcy on June 1, 2009. This is just perspective as to how bad the auto industry was in 2008, now I’m not saying it’s just as bad in 2021 but let me put the pieces together as to why this relates to **Workhorse.**

The downfall of the auto industry seemed like a no-brainer to short sellers to make boatloads of cash from struggling companies that were on the verge of bankruptcy. It was looked at as an “easy win”, “easy money.” “Let’s profit off of it, let’s short these companies!” 

Like I said earlier the auto industry was getting wrecked, so you can only imagine how luxury car companies are doing in this financial crisis as well. **Porsche** was fighting bankruptcy, just like every other car company was in 2008. Who the hell is buying a Porsche in a recession? Prior to 2008, **Porsche** was already a shareholder in **Volkswagen,** and as 2008 progressed, **Porsche** cleverly increased their holdings in **Volkswagen. Porsche** had increased their position to **30%,** then **44%** in *October 2008.* **Porsche** was holding **44%** in shareholder equity, but they also held Options for an additional **30%,** which gives a total of **74%** of **Volkswagen** shares. Very clever move…

It was estimated that the *short interest* in Volkswagen was only **12.80%.** In today’s market that doesn’t seem too noteworthy (Workhorse’s *Short Interest*: **39%**). Now, since **Porsche** owned practically 75% of **Volkswagen** share equity, it went from the market assuming that there is an available *Float* of **45%** to all of a sudden realizing there is a *Float* of not even **%1** of outstanding shares. 

*With more than 70% of Volkswagen stock controlled by Porsche, short sellers realized there was nothing available to cover bearish bets. There was no stock float. All, or most, of Volkswagen shares were accounted for. The door shorts had to run through to exit their positions turned out to be microscopic.* ***-  Baaron’s***

When there is such little *Float* available on the market, when people are expecting there to be so much MORE *Float* then there initially is, it creates a Supply and Demand issue. And that’s exactly what **Porsche** knew was going to happen, a Supply and Demand issue. All of the short sellers needed to immediately ‘Buy to Close’ their positions in **Volkswagen.** Millions of shares worth of **Volkswagen** needed to be purchased but there were just not enough shares to be issued out and sold. When there is a ton of demand, very little supply, the price of the supply inflates like crazy. And that inevitably became the **Volkswagen** Short Squeeze of ‘08.

Over the span of this historical short squeeze the price of **Volkswagen** ended up breaking **€1005 ($1,190.69).** In the midst of the greatest financial crisis in the last 50 years, **Volkswagen** (very briefly) became the most valuable company in the entire world. That is the potential of a well engineered short squeeze… 

**Porsche**, the Hedge Fund that also makes cars, made 30 billion dollars in a few *short* weeks. (Pun intended) 

Now, how does this relate to **Workhorse**?

Let me put this in perspective…

**Volkwagen’s Short Interest:** *12.80%*

**Workhorse’s Short Interest:** *39%*

**Workhorse’s Float:** *115 Million*

**Workhorse’s Outstanding Shares:** *123 Million* 

The *Short Interest* for Workhorse is 3x greater than **Volkwagen’s** Short Interest was in 2008, the main message here is to **OWN THE FLOAT!!!**

**IF WE OWN THE FLOAT, WE CAN SQUEEZE THIS LEMON!!!**

It is better to buy shares than call options and I know we all want to print tendies, but owning and not selling the *Float* will be a better scenario for all of us, so we aren’t YOLOing ‘out of the money’ call options to donate our cash to Wall Street or Robinhood. In order for us to make this horse gallop, we must own the float, let **Porsche** be a great reminder that retail investors can have just as much of an impact on a specified stock than any hedge fund can. 

LET’S SQUEEZE THIS LEMON!!! THIS HORSE WILL SOON GALLOP!!!

**WORKHORSE FOR THE WIN!!!**"

Renewing interest in the Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) sector with its success, E3 is ushering in a ""new era"" for both the province and DLE-focused companies. (Source: [https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/alberta-enters-global-lithium-race-with-opening-of-first-extraction-pilot-project-1.1968555](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/alberta-enters-global-lithium-race-with-opening-of-first-extraction-pilot-project-1.1968555)) 

**Another challenger in the industry has arisen in the form of Volt Lithium (VLT.v VLTLF, 35M Market Cap), breaking out due to the renewed DLE interest, a ""growing, pure-play lithium development and technology company, aiming to be North America's first commercial producer of lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonates from oilfield brine""**

In this Streetwise Reports Article, Michael Ballanger of GGM Advisory cited VLT as a game-changing lithium find amid the escalating demand for lithium and essential battery metals driven by electric vehicle manufacturing, stemming from VLT's innovative IES-300 DLE technology: [https://www.streetwisereports.com/article/2023/08/22/volt-lithium-a-life-changing-find.html](https://www.streetwisereports.com/article/2023/08/22/volt-lithium-a-life-changing-find.html)  

Designed to extract lithium from oilfield brines, VLT's DLE technology boasts an impressive lithium recovery rate, reaching 90% from concentrations as low as 34 mg/L and remarkable 97% recoveries using 120 mg/L concentrations, all while maintaining commercial viability. 

By removing contaminants from oilfield brine to use in their DLE technology, VLT additionally offers a compelling opportunity to oil and gas operators, presenting a win-win situation by adding value to existing oilfield operations.

Further emphasizing VLT's potential is its Rainbow Lake Project which showcases a substantial lithium resource of 4.3 million tonnes with concentrations reaching up to 121mg/L. On track to release a PEA for Rainbow Lake this year, VLT is aiming to produce 1,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide by the end of June 2025.

Fortified by a recent financing round of approximately $6.8M, VLT is equipped with the necessary capital required to execute its focus, including the implementation of its DLE production method by the second half of 2024 at its Rainbow Lake Property.

post,116c6le,stockstobuytoday,Confidential Computing Breakthroughs Signal a LT Opportunity for $HUBC $MSFT $INTC Investors,OldBay_Trader,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/116c6le/confidential_computing_breakthroughs_signal_a_lt/,10,"Advances in the field of confidential computing is proving to be a major force for cyber security and data security innovation across multiple industries. Confidential computing uses encryption, hardware-level isolation, and trusted execution environments (TEEs) to protect sensitive data while it is being used or processed. This new technology promises enhanced levels of privacy, safety, and control over digital assets that were previously impossible with traditional cloud computing infrastructure. 

A recent report from market intelligence firm Everest Group states that “confidential compute has rapidly become an essential component of any enterprise cybersecurity strategy."" The report goes on to note that investments made by these leading providers are ""likely undervalued"" compared to the gains they'll produce over coming years - suggesting now could be an ideal time for investors interested in capitalizing on this emerging space. 

The same report highlights several key trends driving growth within the sector: increasing pressures from regulatory bodies such as GDPR; rising demand for AI/ML applications; growing awareness amongst businesses about the importance of protecting their data assets; improving accessibilities thanks to open source initiatives like Open Enclave SDK; more cost effective solutions becoming available due advances such as Intel SGX technology; increased adoption rates amongst cloud providers including Amazon Web Services (AWS); etc.. In short – it seems clear that momentum behind confidential compute is only going increase moving forward.  

https://preview.redd.it/ti4qpc55i5ja1.png?width=1185&format=png&auto=webp&s=15461d61bd7d05f3e90b1c5dfd6715673a9f3d28

Three of the major players in this field include HUB Security (reserved NASDAQ: HUBC), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). For tech investors, these companies have multi-bagger potential over a intermediate-to-long term horizon. $HUBC hails from Israel, and is in the final stages of completing a SPAC-listing via RNER. HUB specializes in creating zero-trust hardware and software solutions that leverage military-grade technology for air-tight data security. Its NASDAQ valuation is earmarked at $1.28b, translating into an initial offering of $10/share. The date of listing is slated for February 28th, so this is a name that most certainly belongs on your watchlist. 

Microsoft and Intel, two mainstays of the global computing industry, are also driving innovation in confidential computing. MSFT offers the use of confidential computing hardware components for Azure, which is considered one of the leading cloud providers worldwide. Mark Russinovich, Chief Technical Officer of Microsoft Azure, recently revealed the new set of virtual machines for cloud-based operations that are equipped with encryption keys which cannot be exported and stored in secure spaces known as Trusted Execution Environments (TEE). These TEEs function like black boxes that store encrypted data inside a protected space only accessible to authorized users. The data can only be accessed if the proper credentials are used.

Intel isn't far behind in the race for innovation in confidential computing. Intel recently unveiled its 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable Processors and the Intel Max Series CPUs and GPUs, together with a virtual machine (VM) isolation solution called “Intel Trust Domain Extension (TDX),” as well as an independent trust verification service. This establishes what is claimed to be the industry's most comprehensive confidential computing portfolio. TDX has been developed to defend data stored in VMs inside a trusted execution environment that is segregated from the hardware below it. Consequently, cloud service providers will not have access to information processed within this TEE.

https://preview.redd.it/ftocqa7qo5ja1.png?width=1239&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc32cc9faff8a0f87402221c05f32d199eac36db

These three companies are blue chip tech players that have dominated the cyber security space for years. With the advent of confidential computing, new investment opportunities for tech veterans are cropping up, and its just a matter of gaining some exposure to the new cutting-edge domain of data and net sec."

post,q16qtc,stockstobuytoday,Top Trending Stocks on Reddit,utradea,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/q16qtc/top_trending_stocks_on_reddit/,9,"Hey Everyone,

Wanted to provide an update for the top trending tickers on Reddit last week. It is interesting seeing if sentiment is a leading or lagging indicator, as well as the correlation to price. The dashboard is a work in progress but so far it has been useful for me to track trending stocks and be able to see new tickers on the leaderboard - before they become too popular.

Dashboard and Trending Stocks

Before we jump in, I wanted to provide a bit of background. This is a work in progress so I want to be transparent with how we are tracking these trends. If you have any thoughts on how I can make this more useful please let me know.

**Tracking Mechanics**

* The algorithm pulls data from multiple subreddits using the reddit API. The subreddits it is pulling from are non-stock specific subreddits (i.e. WBS, investing, stockmarket, pennystocks, etc.)
* It then plots mentions with price over a give timeframe (Right now you can look at 72hrs, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month)
* We also display sentiment, number of posts, comments, and upvotes. Sentiment is determined using Spacy and a text classification dictionary

**Why did we build this?**

* We wanted a way to track social sentiment across a number of social media platforms. Studies show that sentiment can impact the price of a stock and we wanted to see if there is a way to leverage this and provide it to individual investors. The more you know, the better.
* Allows you to see the overall trends, and the quickly drill into the posts to validate the content.

**Future plans**

* **Twitter (Beta)** \- currently testing a way to capture twitter sentiment. I think there is opportunity to follow and track what a number of the largest Fintwit accounts discus and corelate to the price movement of smaller cap stocks. This is my hypothesis but I need to test it.
* **Social Trend Score -** ultimately we want to be able to identify trending ticker before the price takes off, or before it drops - we are planning on incorporating data from multiple social platform

Top 10 Trending Stocks on Reddit

The screenshot is pulled from the Social Sentiment Dashboard and shows the top trending tickers in the last 72hrs.

**CEI -** **Camber Energy, Inc.**, an independent oil and natural gas company, engages in the acquisition, development, and sale of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGL) in the Cline shale and upper Wolfberry shale in Glasscock County, Texas. **2 weeks ago this was sitting at number 18 on the leaderboard**. It was getting a lot of traction on twitter and started to get more mentions on Reddit. It is now sitting at #4 on on top trending tickers. Over this time period the price increased close to 200%. I will need to look at this further but if I look back at the data it might be a good my to test the hypothesis.

**SDC - SmileDirectClub, Inc**. operates as an oral care company. It offers clear aligner therapy treatment. This has been in the top 5 over the last 2 weeks. There have been a significant number of posts and mentions on WSB for SDC - a lot of DD floating around. A month ago it was sitting at #17, and then 2 weeks ago was #1 and was at $6.90 per share. Since that peak 2 weeks ago the pricedeclined \~25% but the mentions and social sentiment has remained strong.

**Other Thoughts**

The other tickers you see are ones that are usually on the leaderboard (AMC, GME, TSLA, QQQ, etc.) which is why it is useful to see what tickers are up and coming on the trend list. This leads me to another thought, it might be useful to be able to filter out certain tickers.

**TLDR**; Track trending tickers on Reddit and potentially catch a ticker before the price hits a peak. The view also provides a way to quickly drill into potentially new tickers or stocks, and find the associated DD.

post,plegi3,stockstobuytoday,KAVL on the climb with a ton of potential,TheMofunkinWolf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/plegi3/kavl_on_the_climb_with_a_ton_of_potential/,10,"KAVL has been taking off over the last couple of days. I think there is still a lot of potential. Here is my write up with sources. 

Background:  KAVL is a public US company. They distribute Bibi Sticks and Bidi Pouches (Product line about to launch soon). The reason the company is structured like this is because Bidi is a foreign manufacturer of vape / tobacco products. It is against US regulations for a foreign manufacturer of these type of products to distribute directly in the US. So KAVL being public in the US is allowed to distribute in the US.  


1. Kaival Brands Innovations Group Inc. is poised To Benefit From Ongoing Shift Away From Combustible Tobacco Products:   
\- To summarize, KAVL has been extremely diligent, making sure their product passes FDA regulation. Many of their competitors fail to do this. It is my assumption that the FDA grants grace periods for new vape products entering the market. Many companies pump during their grace period, then dissolve and restructure. You have seen this with Puff >Fume and other similar companies. KAVL has built their company around making sure they meet FDA regulations so they can build their product and brand.

4. They took a hit after the last Quarterly Reporting.   
 ""Kaival Brands recognizes revenue in two ways, which is similar to other consumer product brands. Typically, the Company will receive an order from a retailer or distributor and subsequently ship from its fulfilment center. Under typical payment terms, Kaival Brands receives payment for the product at the time the customer obtains control of the products. In addition, the Company has some contracts with 120-day payment terms, which is common practice when working with larger wholesalers and distributors. With respect to these types of orders, Kaival Brands fulfills and ships the entire product order upfront to the distributor, and then receives payment for products upon sale of the product by the wholesale or distributor, as applicable, payable on a recurring monthly basis. This payment cycle lasts 120-days. Our most recent orders with 120-day terms, represents an aggregate of approximately $41.6 million, were placed in April 2021 by GSW and C-Store Master. Despite these orders being placed in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, revenue recognition rules require us to recognize revenues once the product sells, or payment is received, of which there can be no assurance.""

5. They have a focus on the China Market and are in 11 other countries.  
 Bidi® Vapor has also been granted two patents in China, which Kaival Brands/Bidi® Vapor view as vital to competing in the world's largest vaping market. The companies have applied for additional patents in the United States and abroad that will expand their IP moat and enhance their reputation for innovation in the fast-growing vape pen market, which Facts & Figures expects to reach $45 billion by 2026.

Price is near it's historical bottom. Gap up looks like it could be in order. Short interest took a huge dive on Friday (without upward action which is key point), and it's peak short interest came sometime in the period where the price went up before the cliff. I think they've already profited as much as they will, so they will eventually close out, causing a nice little ramp (and gap up)"
post,pcspou,stockstobuytoday,"MKTY, the undiscovered biggest competitor of Riot and Mara",Dylanbos33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/pcspou/mkty_the_undiscovered_biggest_competitor_of_riot/,10,"&#x200B;

With bitcoin rising again, miners have been in a tailwind. Given high valuations of MARA and RIOT, I've been looking at under-the-radar companies operating in miners industry.

I found out that MKTY was pretty interesting. They don't operate as RIOT and MARA.

**MKTY Edge:**

* Operates at lower cost than MARA, and 4x cheaper than RIOT
* Managed by a PE firm
* Is more likely to be resilient to volality, since they sell their the currency mined
* Currently operating a 2.6 MW Facility in Washington State, and plans to expand to 53MW by end of the year. All their equipment has been bought from another miner bankruptcy from a few years ago (→ not subject to shortage equipment as opposed to any other competitor)  

* **Unconscionably low valuation – 3.5x EV/EBITDA and 28% FCF yield based on 1Q’22 run-rate**  
**1Q’22 run-rate guidance may be highly conservative based on recent developments**  
**Aligned and incentivized CEO with an impressive background in Private Equity**  
**Significant embedded upside optionality (ESG, SOTP, BTC price and strategic alternatives)**  
**Several catalysts to potentially make excess returns in the very near term (< 3 month*****s)***

**Cost to mine**

* **MKTY energy cost: 0.024$ / KwH**
* Mara energy cost: 0.028$ / KwH
* Riot energy cost: 0.08$ / KwH (historial energy cost)

**Currently trading at an heavy discount compared to MARA and RIOT**

* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of RIOT : 423x
* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MARA: 995x
* **Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MKTY: 12x**

**Why is MKTY under-the-radar?**

* Recently uplisted on the Nasdaq
* Small Market Cap ($120mm)
* Management team focussing on execution rather than PR
* Low float & high insider ownership (40%)
* Low volume (about 90k shares / day)

**Conclusion** MKTY sounds like a company to keep an eye on given all these reasons.

post,12sx8dt,stockstobuytoday,A List of Biotech Stocks With Major Price Movement and Continued Upside Potential.,ThePharmacyInvestor,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/12sx8dt/a_list_of_biotech_stocks_with_major_price/,10,"Here is a list of stocks that have seen big price movement recently with continued upside potential. 

EYPT: When I first called out this stock, it was trading only a few cents away from 52-week lows indicating that it was severely undervalued and a reversal was due soon. I was correct, the reversal was the exact day that I called out this stock. The stock has gone up over 100% just in the last thirty days meaning that perhaps it is somewhat overextended. However, this 100% increase over the last month was stimulated by the fact that there was about a 20% increase on March 27th when the company released news that they had completed enrollment in oversubscribed phase 2 DAVIO 2 clinical trial of EYP-1901 for maintenance treatment of wet AMD. This clearly shows that investors and the market are excited for what’s to come.

ALDX: The stock for this company is trading way higher than its 52-week lows; in fact, it’s reaching its 52-week highs which may indicate that the catalyst is priced in. However, as always, biotech stocks are unpredictable. If this drug gets approved with minor restrictions and it’s marketed and produced correctly, this could be a huge long term winner for the company.

ICPT: This companies stock price is up almost 60% in the last 3 weeks without any major news being released. This indicates that this is simply a build-up to the catalyst which raises the following question: Is this catalyst priced in? There is a larger than normal chance that this catalyst is priced in because it is trading near 52 week highs after extending upwards 60% over the short time period of 3 weeks. This means that there is a possibility of the advisory meeting being a sell off. This stock is unique however because there are two plays with this one company: the Advisory Meeting and the FDA Approval. If the advisory meeting is a sell off event, that will greatly increase the chances of a big jump on FDA approval, especially considering the magnitude of this catalyst and that it is revolutionary for its market. However, if the advisory meeting does see the stock jump up in price (in my opinion, I am leaning towards a sell off), then perhaps the FDA approval will be a sell off event.

IBRX: This stock has been beat down quite heavily over the last few months but it has just undergone a very strong reversal. In the last 5 days alone, the stock has went up more than 50%. However, if you look at the chart, you will realize that this is still nothing compared to its potential. The FDA approval is upcoming in a little over a month and if the stock remains this undervalued by the time the FDA approval comes along (and the FDA approves the drug of course), there is a huge amount of upside potential!

In light of this, keeping an eye on quantum computing stocks, supercomputer tokens, and distributed computing cryptocurrencies could be worthwhile. 

What Is Quantum Computing? Computers that use quantum theory are the main component of this technology field. This method of estimation essentially indicates that quantum computers will be able to outperform today’s state-of-the-art supercomputers and will represent the most disruptive innovation in tech since the advent of computers.  

Given this vast long-term potential for the field, here are a few players I for one am slapping onto my watchlist for a proper entry:

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)

Market Cap \~ $378.8 Billion

Sector – Communication Services

Price – $151.52

Nvidia is a chip and computing stock that has taken the world by storm. Its products are employed in expanding markets such as the gaming, data center, automotive, and professional visualization sectors. With its graphics processing units (GPUs), which boost computational capacity, NVIDIA is swiftly becoming the world leader in cutting-edge semiconductor designs, powering the next generation of technology.

IonQ (NYSE: IONQ)

Market Cap \~ $913 Million

Sector – Industrials

Price – $4.61

IonQ just went public through a combination with the unique purpose acquisition company (SPAC) dMY Technology Group III. The first pure-play quantum computer business to go public is IonQ, a start-up in the quantum computing industry. Will use the cash gained from the SPAC merger to fund the construction of a network of quantum computers that will be accessible through various cloud services. IonQ has partnerships with Microsoft, Google Cloud, and Amazon’s Web Services to demonstrate the company’s focus on cloud computing. In addition to investing in IonQ, the Japanese telecoms major and tech investor Softbank Group has partnered with the firm to use quantum computing to power the many other tech firms in its portfolio.

HUB (TASE:HUB.TA) 

Market cap-$604.64M 

Sector-cybersecurity 

Price- 515.70 NIS 

HUB Cyber Security (Israel) was founded in 2017 by former members of the Israeli Defense Forces' special intelligence units. The company specializes in cutting-edge cyber-security solutions that safeguard confidential government and commercial data. In addition to presenting a brand-new set of data theft protection technologies, the company introduced an advanced encrypted computing solution designed to thwart hostile intrusions at the hardware level. A global provider of cutting-edge cybersecurity computing products and a broad range of cybersecurity services with operations in over 30 nations.

As seen in the chart, HUB (+27.12% YTD) is far-outperforming its sectoral peers as quantum computing has recently taken off in the last couple of months, and despite recent double-digit declines in tech. For instance, mega  IT firms such as MSFT (-16.65% YTD), APPL (-7% YTD), YOJ (-38.94% YTD), and META (-49.38% YTD) have all underperformed in comparison to HUB. This is the case as well for sectorial peers like IONQ (-63% YTD) and NVDA (-39.50% YTD, likewise fall far short of the YTD gains of HUB. HUB has outperformed relative to the Nasdaq baseline QQQ  by about 48%, demonstrating just how bullish this stock is in the face of an extended bear market.

As quantum computing has applications to nearly every industry, including military defense and biowarfare, governments have increased spending in an effort not to fall behind competing countries. So far, the European Union and the United States have pledged $7.2 billion and $1.3 billion respectively, with China having announced a whopping $15 billion in planned government funding. Although quantum computing is still in its infancy, significant research funding is being invested in this cutting-edge technology. Even though there aren’t many pure-play quantum equities yet, investing in tech behemoths that have exposure to the field could pay off handsomely in the coming"

post,rox9h1,stockstobuytoday,International IoT Disruptor Plays $ALRM $TRAC,_Analystica,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/rox9h1/international_iot_disruptor_plays_alrm_trac/,10,"IoT Security Innovators that are Worth the Watch

The IoT revolution is nothing new. It has actually been with us for quite a while now. And while it has tremendous market growth potential, at this point it seems like the good companies are already well established and over priced. But rest assured, there are still a couple of hidden gems out there that are only at the very beginning of their business evolution. Luckily, they also hold great potential for becoming serious disruptors and make innovative use of the IoT. 

The IoT (internet of things) is simply a fancy name referring to online networks of devices that are connected to the internet and are communicating with other devices in the same network via connections to data centres. Think of smart light bulbs that you can turn on using a phone app or a smart house where you can control lights, music, locks, etc. online. These are all examples of IoT based developments. 

More recently, new IoT companies are moving away from just focusing on connectivity and go further into application development, platform hosting and other services. With innovation growing, the IoT sector attracted nearly $20B last year and new startups are popping by everywhere and in 2020 attracted around 70% of total investments in IoT. Just in 2020, the IoT market grew by 20% (currently estimated at $300B) and this trend is projected to continue with a 25% CAGR in the next 5-7 years. And with market projections this positive, I’ve done some digging to try and find some of these companies that I believe are still undervalued and hold the potential to double down fast. 

[Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) (NASDAQ: ALRM) 

Founded in 2000, [Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) develops cloud-based home or business security systems that are already used in millions of homes across the US and Canada. The system enables users to control their home or business devices (security cameras, lights, locks, air conditioning, etc.) through an internet based app. Alarm provides customers with its SaaS software and currently has over 100M devices connected to its data servers. In the past two years, Alarm also broadened its connectivity to include cars, cameras and water valves. 

ALRM’s market cap is currently valued at $4.1B with a share price ranging between $73-108 and an average volume of 188K. In terms of stock price action, the past 3 weeks has seen a modest 2.2% increase. While this seems to be a minor share price increase, market projections are highly positive for smart home security and ALRM’s connectivity seems to provide a solid starting point.    

T42 (AIM:TRAC)

Similarly to what Alarm is doing with house security, T42 is providing security solutions to the maritime shipping industry, which is currently lagging far behind what cutting-edge tech can offer. In a bid to address this market gap enter T42, an IoT, satellite-based technology company that provides tracking solutions for maritime shipping containers. T42 develops and manufactures a state-of -the-art smart lock that monitors containers and transmits real time data about security hazards to clients. T42’s lock provides real time data and alerts (saved on the company’s cloud server), monitoring containers’ location, humidity levels, temperature, impacts, door openings etc. 

T42 is still in its early stages as a company, with a market cap of $8.6M GBP average volume estimated at 350K. Last week, T42 announced a $40M deal with Latin American ports which led to a 100% jump in share price jumping within a single trading session. And while T42 is still a new player in the field of IoT, its market projections are also highly positive and seeing deals starting to flow in sets it on a great course.  

Other than ALRM and TRAC, there seems to be an analyst consensus about larger companies such as Cisco (CSCO), Amazon (AMZN) and Garmin (GRMN). I still need to do my proper DD on the large caps ones, but for those of you interested in some innovative IoT small caps, ALRM and TRAC have the potential to solidify as future security leaders each in its own field. I’ll keep an eye out, hope you will too. I’m not an adviser of course, so make sure to do your own research. Happy holidays!"

The fact is that “Syfovre” is FDA approved and only 6 people had this issue out of 60000 !!!
And it is mentioned on the site that this might be a possible side effect.
If you were to punish every pharma for 1/10000 side effect by over 60%+ you would bankrupt all of them.
In any case, we will get official reaction in a few days when they have the shareholders meeting.
I bought some yesterday and more today, the volume was huge so am guessing the bounce to the upside will be pretty good too,
Just look at “T” ATT, and that was a real concern, but still it popped.

(NASDAQ: MTNB) is another great opportunity to look out for because of its amazing upside potential! This company is looking to present its phase 2 findings on April 18, 2023 for Oral amphotericin b (MAT2203) also known as the (EnACT) study which treats Cryptococcal meningitis, a condition with a market that is expected to reach more than $7 billion by the end of 2027!

All patients treated with MAT2203 who completed the induction phase achieved **sterile** CSF cultures during treatment (either during induction or early consolidation phases).

* There was no evidence of breakthrough or relapsed cryptococcal infections observed in any of the patients during treatment with MAT2203 through 10 weeks.
* In Cohort 2, overall survival was 95% in 40 patients randomized to receiving MAT2203.
* More in the article...

Foreseeable future of the companies fundamentals!

* The company is forecast to break even in 2025 (within the next three years which is considered above average market growth)
* Full year 2022 EPS and revenue exceeded analyst expectations
* Very high growth revenue (more than double the market)
* The companies short term and long term liabilities are far less than their short term and long term assets.

post,10vcz6k,stockstobuytoday,Universal cancer vaccine with very promising effect! (Multi-bagger potential) Part 2,Ultimovacs4ever,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/10vcz6k/universal_cancer_vaccine_with_very_promising/,8,"A few weeks ago, I shared information regarding the INITIUM study conducted by Ultimovacs, which demonstrated a substantial increase in progression-free survival compared to historical controls. Additional details on this matter can be accessed at the following link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/10c1ane/universal\_cancer\_vaccine\_with\_very\_promising/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/10c1ane/universal_cancer_vaccine_with_very_promising/)

In line with the full recruitment of [NIPU](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04300244) study on January 23rd, I would like to present an update on the event probability analysis for this study. The accompanying graph displays the enrolment progress for NIPU as reported by the company and compared to a proxy representation of Covid-19 intensity in Norway. As depicted, enrolment has remained consistent throughout the duration of this period.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sc4w80yhkmga1.png?width=614&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b4188155e7599948252f4e666b18eea5cfea483

The NIPU study is an event-driven clinical trial with 118 participants, divided into two arms of 59 individuals each. Both arms receive a combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab, while the experimental arm also receives UV1.

The accompanying plot presents the probability of various events, based on the assumption that the population follows the reference study (CheckMate-743). The PFS readout for the study is at 69, with a threshold of no effect set at 34 events and a significant effect defined as 40 events. The plot suggests a high likelihood that 34 events have already been achieved, and at present, there is approximately a 50% probability that 37 events have been achieved. This equates to a theoretical hazard ratio (HR) of approximately 0.8, as indicated in the HR plot shown later in this update. The probability of a significant result surpasses 50% computationally, starting from mid-March 2023.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ehu0fv9xulga1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e8f225f43dd46d0b81b6f40e4cb83df3bc7869b

Theoretical HR-ratio for NIPU:

The last plot compares the results of the INITUM (CM511) and NIPU (CM743) studies. The plot suggests a high likelihood of UV1 having a positive effect in the INITUM study and that the probability of UV1 having an effect in the NIPU study is rapidly increasing.

&#x200B;

**A significant opportunity exists here that the market has yet to realize.**

Ultimovacs, the Norwegian biotechnology company developing the universal cancer vaccine UV1, is publicly listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in Norway under the ticker symbol ULTI. The company's current market capitalization is 424 970 955 USD.

**If you have any questions about Ultimovacs or UV1, feel free to ask them in the comment section, and I will try to answer them to the best of my ability.**

P.S.: Much of the aforementioned text and graphs is borrowed from Ketilaaj."
comment,j7h6w45,stockstobuytoday,Universal cancer vaccine with very promising effect! (Multi-bagger potential) Part 2,Ultimovacs4ever,,1,"NIPU:

This randomized, multi-center phase II study evaluated the efficacy of  the universal cancer vaccine UV1 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors ipilimumab and nivolumab as a second-line treatment for mesothelioma. Sponsored by Oslo University Hospital and supported by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Ultimovacs, the trial enrolled 118 patients, with half receiving the combination treatment and half receiving nivolumab and ipilimumab alone. The primary objective of the study is to determine whether the combination of UV1, ipilimumab, and nivolumab leads to a clinically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) after progression on first-line standard platinum doublet chemotherapy."

If you know post pls ?"
comment,hsjke6k,stockstobuytoday,$BBIG trending up last two days,tendieful,,3,"They completed their audit which resulted in 600k share buyback at 2.74 which were canceled.  This potential looming bad news turned out to be not so bad an a net positive by reducing the float. 

The options chain for next week is fucking retarded. 500k otm options and institutions own over 300k. They have the means and desire to make the price go there. Looming news on dividend payout on the stock in the form of 10:1 BBIG to TYDE shares for a new ticker on nasdaq for their subsidiary crypto mining company. 150m volume today. The stock already squeezed back sep 09 to $12 on 300m volume. If volume maintains tomorrow then we will blow through the options chain and have a huge gamma squeeze. MM's will start delta hedging the fuck out of it. If management releases news on the stock this will be another massive driver. Fomo buyers kick in. Once it's over 1bn market cap WSB will jump in. Finally short interest is around 26% so if shorts are margin called or cant afford interest rates or decide to cover due to risk exposure then the stock is going to pop off. 

Any one of these catalysts is enough to continue driving the stock. Convergence of 2-3 or all of them will make this an easy 10 bagger. 

Holding 800 shares, 3400 share in OTM calls dated next week and april 14th. 

Sold calls I bought this morning for a nice 100% as well."

post,rnypxo,stockstobuytoday,Deep value vs Dividend!,AnonymusFarmer,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/rnypxo/deep_value_vs_dividend/,8,"Good Morning Investors, 

I am a young Finance student with lots of ideas and plans. 

I would like to ask you, as you were my friends, about my little project:

* Share my Equities Portfolios
* Share my studies and little researches 
* Create a positive community of Non-Degenerated young investors

For example, during the last couple of months, I have been working on 2 different portfolios.

The First is a dividend king portfolio with a high dividend yield and the second one, is a small group of equities that would call ""Deep Value"".  

Is someone interested in knowing my work and my studies?

&#x200B;

Stay safe and have a lot's of Capital Gain!"
comment,hpvq1ks,stockstobuytoday,Deep value vs Dividend!,Kitchen_Ad_344,,1,Yes shout me a message
comment,hpwyyaj,stockstobuytoday,Deep value vs Dividend!,mjs54,,1,"Here’s an experiment for you.  Identify the top dividend payers (large caps) and buy an equal weighted allocation in January.  Then, once a year (so you get capital gains tax) rotate them making sure you own the top ten equal weighted.  If one drops out of the top ten, simply replace it so you always start with the top ten every January.  Do a study to see how you would have done over the past 20 years.  Then compare that to simply holding a total domestic stock index fund for the same period.  It would be interesting to see the outcome.  Of course, you’d have to reinvest the dividends received because you want to get a total return return.  Good luck."
comment,hpyx4mu,stockstobuytoday,Deep value vs Dividend!,mjs54,,1,"I forgot.  Only buy 25 holdings.  This gives you a 4% holding per stock.  This protects against unusual events that might crush an individual holding.  If crushed, won’t hurt that bad.  Since you are picking high dividend stocks, you don’t have the upside per holding as a highly volatile growth stock, so you won’t be losing upside potential from the diversification."
comment,hqvq7an,stockstobuytoday,Deep value vs Dividend!,What-Dahell,,1,"I love your openness and honesty, at one-time or another many on r/reddit were College students  gnot so long ago 93 I myself graduated from SLU, I think you'll find most on reddit kind and generous with their advice, yes even friends interested in your projects! I'm interested in your, what did you call it, small cap/small account project because as of 2022 I've been preparing to start one of my own!

I welcome you and i have a great interest in small cap/Penny stock portfolios! For years it's been my dream to build a small market cap portfolio, but I've put if off because of my disability (paralyzed Quadraplegic) and because I'm suffering from and fighting 'Squamous Cell Carcinoma' an oral cancer of the head, neck throat. If I continue putting it off, I may never get this opportunity again live out my dream because of my health?

You as a College finance major, have heard the stories of someone starting with a small stake a $1,000.00 and turning it into a six figure portfolio in 18 months, I hope to be that certain someone with a similiar story someday but can I do it from my hospice bed with my health concerns? 

It's been my dream for many years and I've been paper trading and doing my DD for two years, I hope my r/reddit friends, brother, and sisters who know more than I about trading have some positive advice they will off without my asking, all advice is welcome!

Are my dreams of having and growing a successful small cap/PennyStock, $5.00 and less, portfolio starting with 2k possible, or should I put an end to my dreams in the cradle?

Happy New Years to my r/reddit friends and family, I'm in a hospice bed 24/7 and I have no friends or family I can call upon for advice, its only me and all who read my words I hope you won't mind if I lean on you for advice. My 1st question, what discourse page or discussion group on r/reddit is best suited for my new venture?"

And I have made some analysis as well with SPY returns. I have reinvested all the Dividends and also simulated an annual contribution of 5000 dollars. I will share some results soon. I can't belive that the dividend Kings not only OUTPERFORMED the SPY by a statistical margin but also they suffered less painful drawdown periods. 
This is also incredible because there are not Technology stocks between the dividend Kings."

Revenue for the quarter was $152 million, an increase of 53% over 2020, and the company added 140 new ""large customers"" during the quarter, which Cloudflare defines as customers tracking to spend $100,000 or more on the platform -- its most ever.  
Cloudflare also continues to see its revenue growth outpace its costs, which puts the business closer to profitability. In 2021 Q2, the business was still burning cash. Free cash flow was negative $9.8 million compared to negative $20.2 million in 2020, but we are heading toward positive free cash flow as time progresses.  
Management's guidance for full-year 2021 suggests revenue of $629 million to $633 million, which would represent almost 47% growth over 2020. The company's revenue grew 50% from 2019 to 2020, so this forward-looking guidance would mean that growth is slightly slowing down -- though Cloudflare is clearly still a rapidly growing business."

post,ocnukp,stockstobuytoday,Apxt to AVPT merger was approved UNDERVALUED,Jimenezmf777,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/ocnukp/apxt_to_avpt_merger_was_approved_undervalued/,9,"JERSEY CITY, N.J., July 1, 2021 -- AvePoint, Inc. (""AvePoint"" or the ""Company""), the largest Microsoft 365 data management solutions provider, announced today the completion of its previously announced business combination with Apex Technology Acquisition Corporation (""Apex""), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company or SPAC.
Apex shareholders approved the transaction at its stockholder's meeting held on June 30, 2021. The combined company is expected to begin trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on July 2, 2021, under the ticker symbol ""AVPT"" for AvePoint common stock and ""AVPTW"" for AvePoint warrants.
""The way we work will never be the same and it continues to evolve,"" said Dr. Tianyi ""TJ"" Jiang, Co-Founder and CEO of AvePoint. ""While collaboration within the cloud grows at an exceptional rate, the promise of digital transformation is only in its infancy. As the largest Microsoft 365 data management solutions provider with two decades worth of reimagining how companies work, AvePoint is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this moment in time.""
The business combination provides an influx of cash to drive accelerated investment in product innovation, channel marketing, international market expansion and customer success initiatives. The Company remains debt-free and is now one of eight public software companies with at least $150 million in annual revenue, 25% YoY growth and a 10% EBITDA margin1.
""The future of work is hybrid, and AvePoint solutions for Microsoft 365 and Teams are transforming the ways in which people collaborate and get work done today,"" said Casey McGee, Vice President, Global ISV Sales, Microsoft. ""There are tremendous growth opportunities for Partners like AvePoint who are enabling secure and compliant collaboration for businesses around the world.""
AvePoint's senior management team, including CEO TJ Jiang, will continue to lead the combined company. Jeff Epstein and Brad Koenig, Co-CEOs of Apex, will join AvePoint's Board of Directors as a director and an advisor, respectively.
""Given AvePoint's leadership in digital collaboration security and data management for Microsoft 365, the company is uniquely positioned to benefit from the shift to remote work collaboration and enterprise cloud adoption,"" said Epstein, Co-CEO of Apex and AvePoint Board Director.
""We believe that AvePoint's attractive growth combined with its financial profile gives the company the opportunity to generate significant long-term shareholder value as a publicly traded company,"" said Koenig, Co-CEO of Apex and AvePoint Board Advisor.
Transaction Overview
AvePoint received approximately $492 million in gross proceeds comprised of Apex's $352 million of cash held in trust following de minimis public stockholder redemptions and $140 million from an ordinary share private investment in public equity (PIPE), excluding transaction fees. The PIPE was anchored by investors including but not limited to Federated Hermes Kaufman Small Cap Fund, Franklin Templeton, Phoenix Insurance Limited and Singapore-based global investor EDBI.
Advisors

LLC (""Goldman Sachs""), Evercore and Cowen Inc. served as capital markets advisors to AvePoint. William Blair & Company served as a financial advisor to Apex.

I didn't no about toshi until yesterday morning. I was on Robinhood hood and I was checking trading platform stocks came across coinbase and seen the had a meme coin. Down loaded coin base yesterday and transferred everything I could get in to my account possible.
I jumped in at .008 with a 1000 dollars
I got in at 9-10 a few more times then around 11. 
Was expecting some corrections never happened. Market cap is so low everybody knows to hold on until the money shows up.black rock vanguard etc. 
Only complaint I have is I have a lot of money to me sitting in other stocks but have no access to it until I sell my positions. 
I also reached my limit for money transfer so I'm stuck with what I got. Wouldn't mind dropping another 10k on this dip though.  just because I can actually feel the gains coming. Just like I did when I sold but coin and doge before it took off. Got all nervous and backed out like an idiot ..."

 These will power the future technological advancements we have whether it’s robots, EVTOL, ARVR headsets, etc. I think this theme is in its infancy. Lithium would be a beneficiary as well.

# Robotics.

This is the real world hardware application of AI, we already have companies such as Tesla, Figure, etc. making major progress. I think we see a breakthrough/ChatGPT moment in 25. 

# Crypto 

Pro crypto administration for the first time. 3rd year of a  4 year cycle. 

# Psychedelics

Posted about earlier. RFK at the helm of healthcare regulation is bullish for psychedelics as he has already advocated for the mainstream adoption of psychedelic drugs. 

# Financials 

 looser regulation under Trump. Almost certainly expect more M&A this year, and this boom in M&A will lead to higher interest in these financial firms' investment banking divisions.  

# Lidar 

Autonomous vehicles and robotics are massive themes. But we need to think about the technologies that are required to make these developments possible. MBLY, INVZ, OUST all names to watch. These provide the hardware and softrware required to make autonomous driving a reality. 

#  Solar 

Best performing sector in the first year of Trump's first term. With Musk's influence too, who has a vested interest in the success of solar, I think we see tailwinds here. 

# Quantum Computing

continuation of mainstream interest. Willow processor showcases quantum’s potential. Scalable quantum technologies address critical challenges in healthcare (accelerating drug discovery), finance (enhancing risk modeling) & logistics (optimizing supply chains) through scalable quantum technologies. GOOGL name behind the sector gives weight. 

# Nuclear 

 Chris Wright on board of OKLO. Likely to see more interest from big cap tech stocks that need to power their interests in AI, as GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT and others have moved to do.

ALXO is focused on developing immuno-oncology therapies targeting CD47 (protein that helps tumors evade the immune system). They are partnered with major pharma companies such as Merck, Jazz, and Lily. These trials can hopefully improve survival rates and offer new treatment options for patients who have limited options today.

comment,mihjrlm,stockstobuytoday,ALXO potential,ACShooter3893,,1,What are your thoughts on why the SP has gone under $1? This has to be heavily shorted and way oversold based on typical biotech stock scrutiny. The most recent readout news from ASPEN-06 didn’t include overall survival (OS) but the market can’t be selling it this much because of that. It’s not like all of there remaining readouts aren’t going to include the overall survival.
comment,mihn62d,stockstobuytoday,ALXO potential,AlxFTBall,,1,"Yes, there is a pretty high short percentage still and way oversold according to the RSI. I think a majority of the downside is just normal market correction that we have seen and the lack of news/profits. I still DCA every so often and profits for ALXO will not be made until one of the trials get FDA approved to begin sales. I like this still with news expected throughout the year.

Alxo will actually be in compliance territory at this rate which will cause the company to do whatever it can to regain compliance so we should see a spike then or a buy back potentially."

ImmunityBio is a pioneering biopharmaceutical company based in San Diego, CA, founded in 2013 by majority shareholder Patrick Soon-Shiong. Since its inception, ImmunityBio has been dedicated to advancing the AL-15 agonist, Anktiva, aimed at combatting various forms of cancer, as well as HIV and HPV. On April 22, 2024, the FDA granted approval for Anktiva's first variant, specifically designed for Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer, with medication hitting the shelves in late May 2024. According to FDA reports, patients experienced a significant enhancement in quality of life after 12 months of Anktiva treatment, with the drug demonstrating improved two-year survival rates compared to other cancer therapies. What sets ImmunityBio apart from other biotech firms is its expansive pipeline, which addresses over 1 million diagnoses annually. The company is currently developing 14 different variants of Anktiva, alongside two Phase 1 clinical trials targeting infectious diseases HIV and HPV. This vast potential creates an enormous addressable market, with the capacity to save hundreds of thousands of lives each year. Furthermore, each approved variant represents a new revenue stream for the company, underscoring its growth potential. In summary, ImmunityBio stands out as a leading biopharmaceutical company with Anktiva, poised to transform cancer treatment and infectious disease management in the coming decade.

comment,mlb16ca,StockMarket,Rate My Portfolio - r/StockMarket Quarterly Thread April 2025,Beginning-Zombie-862,,1,"**System I'm Using (Started January 3rd):**

I use Finviz to filter stocks based on fundamentals and momentum. These are the filters I use:

* **Market Cap**: Over $10 billion
* **P/E Ratio**: Over 10
* **EPS Growth (Past 5 Years)**: Positive
* **Sales Growth (Past 5 Years)**: Over 10%
* **Debt-to-Equity**: Under 1
* **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Over 10%
* **Operating Margin**: I adjust this based on how many stocks pass.  - If too many pass, I raise it by 5%  - If too few pass (under 5 stocks), I lower it by 5%
* **Price Above SMA50 & SMA200**
* **RSI**: Under 60

Once I filter the stocks, I score them based on these 4 categories:

* EPS Growth (higher = better)
* Debt-to-Equity (lower = better)
* Operating Margin (higher = better)
* Distance above SMA50 (higher = better)

Each stock gets points based on how it ranks in those 4 categories. I invest more money in the higher-scoring stocks, and usually hold between **5 and 8 stocks** at a time.

**When I Sell a Stock:**

I sell a stock if:

1. It no longer meets **any one** of the filters above **OR**
2. A new stock enters that meets all filters and has a higher operating margin, and I already own 8 stocks — in that case, I remove the stock with the weakest operating margin to stay within my 5–8 range.

**Where I'm At:**

* I started the system on **January 3rd**
* By **February 11th**, I was up **18%**
* Now it’s **April 2nd**, and I’m **back to breakeven**

It’s worth noting that about **5% of that 18% gain came from one lucky earnings jump**. The rest of the gains were just from following my system."

Want to offer some commentary on markets?  Maybe you would just like to throw out a neat fact that doesn't warrant a self post?  Feel free to post here! 

&#x200B;

If your question is ""I have $10,000, what do I do?"" or other ""advice for my personal situation"" questions, you should include relevant information, such as the following:

&#x200B;

\* How old are you? What country do you live in?  

\* Are you employed/making income? How much?  

\* What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)  

\* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?  

\* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)  

\* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)  

\* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?  

\* And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.  .  

Be aware that these answers are just opinions of Redditors and should be used as a starting point for your research. You should strongly consider seeing a registered investment adviser if you need professional support before making any financial decisions!"

Mark Carney on his opinion of restructuring US economy.  

Mark Carney on Friday was asked, as an economist, what he thinks the effect of Donald Trump’s policies will have on the US economy and how it will affect Canada’s economy. It’s, of course, pretty measured and clear eyed about what the effect will be. This comment stood out as another Carney mic drop.

“Well the second part of your question is easy, which is a recession in the United States always negatively impacts Canada.

We have had examples when the US has had a recession and we haven’t had a recession. I’m trying to remember who was Governor of the Bank of Canada at the time when that happened. Oh yeah it was me.”

You can check out the whole exchange on Youtube. 

This is what people who know him says about him:

“He’s a force... He will be tough for the Americans to deal with. He’ll make mincemeat out of the second-raters in the Trump team. It’ll be a bloodbath if [Trump and Carney] ever confront each other because he just doesn’t take prisoners” - Economic Historian Adam Tooze on Mark Carney"

But, all the globalists decrying the these policies is kind of ridiculous. These are the same people that rely on the status quo. Of course they’re upset. The opposition to these tariffs seem desperate for everyone to believe the world is ending. The status quo is exactly why Trump got elected (I didn’t vote for him). It almost seems like the people that stand to lose some of the control they’ve built up over last 40 years are nervous. And instead of actually learning anything and talking about working class people they just want the world to burn so they can continue with impunity. It’s kind of surprising that so many people are cheering on a system that we all know is built on exploitation of the cheapest possible labor. You’re going to forge new relationships with China? Have fun, I’m sure they won’t violate any agreements you make with them. I’m sure they will be an awesome partner that doesn’t screw you over. 

To be sure, I think what Trump is doing is irresponsible and damaging to a number of relationships, and while they may need adjustment it’s foolish to be so aggressive about everything. But these same people that hate Trump and his policies have had decades to foster relationships with the working class that voted for him. And they failed. This whole situation saddens me, I think Trump is crazy and I think the left doesn’t actually want to acknowledge their part in the creation of this problem. That way they don’t have to actually change anything. What’s wild is Trumps approval rating is higher than the Democratic Party. Significantly higher. To hell with all of this."

That message is, do not trust the US ever again, and in doing so, they may lose their status as the most reliable nation, and with it, the greenback loses its status as the reserve currency.

The US hasn't prepared itself for what happens in such a circumstance, they can't borrow as freely in the future and that raises their borrowing costs.

The Euro, whilst not as strong, is more stable.  The Renminibi isn't as liquid and tradeable.  The yen doesn't have the strength.  The pound is too small and too dysfunctional.  

Effectively, the world may be without a reserve currency for some time."

This is how a highly-qualifiedand intelligent  leader of a country speaks.

This is how an imbecile speaks:

“Look, having nuclear — my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, okay, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart — you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, okay, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I’m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world — it’s true! — but when you’re a conservative Republican they try — oh, do they do a number — that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune — you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged — but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me — it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are (nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what’s going to happen and he was right — who would have thought?), but when you look at what’s going on with the four prisoners — now it used to be three, now it’s four — but when it was three and even now, I would have said it’s all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don’t, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years — but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.”"

If not US then who?  
There are some fundamental facts that are the same today as they were yesterday right? A few of those being:  
1. The US is still the largest economy in the world.  
2. The US is still the richest market in the world.  
3. The US is still a leader in innovation and with a robust educational institutions based pipeline to keep the innovation going.  
4. It still is a talent magnet and every smart person prefers to move to US over say China or Japan or Korea. Even in case of EU, most immigrants that EU receives are from South Asian countries and many aren't really highly skilled ones. Quite a few are those who couldn't make it to the US.  
5. The US is a major energy supplier even if not energy independent (thanks to them not being able to refine the oil they produce).  
6. Goes without saying but they weild the biggest stick out there ($900 billion strong).  
7. Still one of the best places for entrepreneurship because of the supportive environment.  

Yes none of these are permanent and all empires in the history of humankind have eventually collapsed but those things take decades if not centuries."

200 years ago when America was new, putting a tax on imported items was actually a good way to increase domestic production. 
The guy importing chairs from Europe now had to raise his fees, and the guy cutting down US lumber and building chairs in his domestic workshop now had a fair chance at becoming established.   

But today, that same guy building chairs in the US not only buys his lumber from another country, which now has a tariff on their lumber, he’s also going to see the increases prices of the chair importer and decided to raise his prices to match them.

Biden was trying to boost domestic manufacturing by improving supply chains to make it more desirable to manufacture and *export* from the US.

Most foreign company’s, particularly car company’s will just take the hit since it would take more than 4 years probably to build a manufacturing plant and get the supply chains set up and by then they get a new administration to deal with.


It’s so breathtakingly stupid. To think you can boost reasonably boost manufacturing while also making it more costly to manufacture.

We’re just going to get a bunch of theatric deals though for company’s to get tariff exemptions like that Foxconn deal.  It will play out nice on campaign ads but no real manufacturing will be brought in."

Our currency has been, until possibly now, been seen as the most stable currency used by the largest economy in the world. It is used as the global reserve currency and used as the default currency for international commodities trade, most notably oil. This makes our currency very strong and even more stable, and at an advantage when being exchanged for other world currencies. As a result, buying foreign items with American dollars is cheap, while buying American items with foreign currencies is more expensive. This (along with our consumer nature) naturally leads us to import more than we export.

So another question needing to be asked:


What companies are going to manufacture in America where they have to pay to import items while also being charged to export those items to other countries? Essentially the only people buying that product in the world is going to be America. 


Then you have to ask:


What countries are going to want to work with American companies when other countries are more reliable and cheaper?


This is why companies moved manufacturing to places like Mexico (Harley Davidson) the last time trump tried this, while also working out trade deals with our former allies. China buying beef from Canada. These things create multiple problems for Americans that a lot of magas won't understand until we are fighting for scraps of food that the rich leaves behind. China took billions from American farmers and gave it to Canadian farmers while also taking away a huge amount of imports from Canada to the USA. The supply is going to dwindle and the demand is going to stay the same causing prices to skyrocket (just look at  eggs).

He is using a stick to beat the companies instead of the more proven method of the carrot. Give them carrots, you can also have the stick ready in case they take the carrot and try to ignore their promises... but always start with the carrot.

I mean, his justification is a lie. He doesn't care about U.S. manufacturing. All of this is meant TO tank the stock market. To beggar U.S. citizens so taht he and his friends can buy the dips AND all the assets that the regular Joe is forced to sell when they can no longer afford to pay their mortgages or interest payments.

This is country level equivalent of ripping out the copper wiring. They are stripping the country of all it's valuables and leaving it barren. They want to make America poor so that all of it's assets can be bought and owned by a few ultra rich people who think they can run it as some kind of techno-feudalistic society."

While this is a tragedy, it is also the new reality.''",magic-moose,,1,"Here's a [good article from the viewpoint of bicycles](https://www.renehersecycles.com/bikes-in-the-age-of-tariffs/).  

>Mass-market products will see the smallest price increase due to tariffs—because manufacturing amounts to just a small fraction of their final price. They are also the only ones that might be re-shored to the U.S. However, it’s just as likely that companies will absorb the price increase—which amounts to just 10-12% in our example above.

>The products that will see the highest price increases due to the tariffs are difficult or impossible to on-shore. They never were made in the U.S., and there is no infrastructure to make them. Prices for these—mostly high-end—products will increase, or they may cease to be offered altogether.

>Paradoxically, U.S. makers of high-end bicycle products may also be negatively affected. Tariffs on raw materials will increase their costs. Reciprocal tariffs—and a loss of goodwill toward the U.S.—will affect the exports that make up a significant part of their business.

>In summary, for the bike industry, it’s hard to see an upside in the current situation. It’s possible that mass-market bikes will be made again in the United States. For the relatively small market of performance or ‘enthusiast’ bikes, there is simply no reasonable alternative to producing them where the infrastructure already exists—and to consolidate production in one place to achieve the economies of scale needed to make these projects viable. Even domestic producers of boutique parts are likely to see their costs increase and exports diminish.

**TL;DR:** 

Manufacture of cheap bikes might return to the U.S., but it could just as easily not.  It may make more sense for bike sellers to just suck it up and pay tariffs.  However, tariffs might actually lock the U.S. out of the high-end market because the scale required to make building niche, high-end products requires manufacturers to amortize their expenses across a global market, and retaliatory tariff's on American goods could make the U.S. a bad place to do that from.

If the manufacture of cheap bikes is *not* on-shored, the U.S. will indeed gain a long-term, but small, stream of tariff revenue.  The price of that is being locked out of the manufacture of high-end or niche goods that rely on global markets to be economically feasible.  The U.S. will pay this price whether low-end manufacturing is on-shored or not.

__________________

**Edit:** 

*If* manufacturers choose to build capacity in the U.S. to avoid tariffs and tariff revenue evaporates, then income tax will still be necessary to run the U.S. government.  If Trump's policy succeeds, it still fails.  At least, it fails in doing what Trump *claims* it is supposed to do: eliminate income taxes. It seems much more likely to fail by not bringing significant manufacturing capacity to the U.S. however.  In that case, tariff revenue will likely still not be as much as projected because consumer behaviour will change.  They'll buy more low-end bicycles because high-end bicycles will not be produced in the U.S. and will be too expensive for most buyers.  In this case, income tax will still likely be necessary."

We can bicker about if Elon helped rig the game or not, but he didn't fake 77 million votes. Far too many people voted for this, and far too many people didn't vote at all.

He immediately started threatening Canada, and MAGA ate it up. Women were bombarded with ""your body, my choice"" threats in the weeks following the election because the rapist-in-chief cow tows with a bunch of other rapists and MAGA thinks it's funny to joke about (or in many cases, say what they actually believe because they view it as acceptable now)

You have shamelessly profiteered while walking a tightrope, staying just on the right side of beneficial. This is why the massive investments in US soft power were absolutely critical. That was the snorkel that was providing you with just enough air to keep on as you were. USAid out? China's belt and road - You have lost Africa and their abundant resources. A lot of US investment is in question there now.

There are enough examples that the rest of the world seem aware of that people in the US just aren't. Your hamfisted approach to policy, to alliances and to trade wasn't endearing you. Hell, you turned NATO into a US welfare program, coercing Europe to pay the majority of your arms research and development bills. The European NATO countries benefitted just enough to not walk away but they weren't exactly thrilled.

The moment you broke those unwritten agreements you dropped so incredibly far into the red, there is realistically no way you are bouncing back in a hurry. You are losing manufacturing capacity, that isn't coming back. You are losing NATO arms deals, you are pissing off other countries (Colombia wanting the JAS-39 Grippen, the USA trying to veto)...

Goodwill is getting thin on the ground. Your trade partners are being forced into looking to alternate deals, your enemies are benefiting (China looking to take the oil currently being sent to the USA!), and once that trade is tied up with other markets those goods aren't available to the USA.

Net exporting companies, who have net US dollars from the trade cycle, have been putting increasing amounts in the US stock market over the last 15 years - more so than bonds which is where they traditionally would put their excess US dollars.   

That situation is likely why the S&P went over about 500% during that period.  The peak of foreign capital in US equity markets occurred December 2024, just a few months ago.   Since then there have been net decreases every month.   Now with tariffs likely hampering trade, meaning less net dollars to those countries, the drain out of US equity markets will be even greater likely.

That capital will flow into south Pacific and European and developing markets.  And it is not just for show and stock prices.  As those equity markets expand, innovated new businesses/startups will start flowing to those markets for the increasing capital which means America will not be the top business innovating nation any more.

How are we even going to deal with this level of stupidity?

>Looking at the alleged tariffs other countries are supposedly levying on U.S. goods, one might be struck by the exorbitant rates in some cases. For example, if China were really imposing a 67% tariff on U.S. goods or if Vietnam were implementing a 90% tariff on U.S. products, that’s something that likely would have been retaliated against a long time ago. But in fact, these numbers do not represent “tariffs.”

>

>Take the E.U. “tariff” on U.S. goods of 39%. In 2024, the U.S. exported $370.2 billion to the E.U., according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Meanwhile, the U.S. imported $605.8 billion from the E.U. That means the U.S. ran a trade deficit with the E.U. of $235.6 billion.

>

>**What the Trump administration seems to have done is taken the deficit ($235.6 billion) and divided it by the total number of imports from the E.U. ($605.8 billion), yielding a figure of 38.89%, which the administration rounded up to 39% and called a “Tariff to the U.S.A.” imposed by the E.U. But obviously, that is not a tariff.**

So to make this clear, since we buy 97% more from Cambodia than they buy from us, he said they have a 97% tariff on us and imposed a 49% tariff in retaliation.

And that number *is not only the wrong THING* it's also the wrong *number* because Trump *only counted goods* and 1/3 of US exports are *services.*

So so so so so so so so stupid!

Now consider that *the Council of Economic Advisers* knows perfectly well the difference between the balance of trade and a tariff, but they can't tell him because he's such a raging narcissist that no one can ever disagree with him and you have to do what he says or he'll make you his next enemy.

So they printed up that table for him to carry to his speech, knowing that 100% of what is printed on it is absolute nonsense.

And because he's a narcissist he wants to be your dictator, to invade Panama, Greenland and Canada. And because he has malignant narcissism as a severe personality disorder and is deeply mentally ill, he wants to do this while basking in the radiance of Vladimir Putin *who he worships and who he emotionally confuses with himself!*

For instance (it took a long time to find a transcript that left in the scary insanity and didn't sane wash Trump):

>“She is asking what if Russia breaks the ceasefire.”

>

>Trump: “What, if anything? What if the bomb drops on your head right now? OK, what if they broke it? I don’t know, they broke it with Biden because Biden, they didn’t respect him. They didn’t respect Obama. They respect me. Let me tell you, *Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia, Russia, Russia! You ever hear of that deal? That was a phony Hunter Biden, Joe Biden scam. ... And he had to go through that Hillary Clinton, shifty Adam Schiff. It was a Democrat scam. And he had to go through that. And he did go through it. We didn’t end up in a war. And he went through it. He was accused of all that stuff. He had nothing to do with it. It came out of Hunter Biden’s bathroom. It came out of Hunter Biden’s bedroom. It was disgusting. And then they said, ‘Oh, the laptop from hell was made by Russia.’ The 51 agents. The whole thing was a scam. And he had to put up with that. He was being accused of all that stuff. All I can say is this: … All I can say is this. He might have broken deals with Obama and Bush, and he might have broken them with Biden. He did, maybe. Maybe he did. I don’t know what happened, but he didn’t break them with me. He wants to make a deal. I don’t know if you can make a deal.”*

I'd like to add that if Trump *IS* doing this on purpose, then the idea is to *threaten* all of the billionaires and corporations so that they come crawling to him and *he can force them to support his dictatorship in return for not immediately putting them out of business.* I think he *stumbled onto a strategy of deliberately hurting the country* by accident. He's a confused old man, but he'll do anything for a big enough bribe. So this works for him.

Congress, not the President is supposed to be in charge of tariffs. Trump is using some bullshit emergency war power. Congress can and should put an end to this charade.

He has the power to veto congress, but *I think he's going to crash the economy and stock market so deeply into depression that an override will be easy to get!* I feel weird making any predictions, but Trump is *so disconnected from reality that the situation is that bad.*"

Let's be honest, Congress is subservient to Trump. SCOTUS has already ruled in favour of unlimited presidential power (with a caveat that it is only applicable if they approve of the president). The current administration is already on track for a world record in breaking laws. I wouldn't be surprised if more power-grabbing were to occur soon."

Till today every manufacturer in China knows that a contract with a US company is most lucrative as they sell volume. Now that is gone, they know that the US can at any point in time just fuck it all up. They will want to hedge against that by increasing their prices for US companies and prioritizing non-US companies to contract with. This is going to be huge deal."

If you even listened to the President of the United States talk yesterday, you’d have seen the two boards that depicted the tariffs. The international tariffs that go with our exports were derived shortly after ww2 and were continued because Europe needed to rebuild. 

So one thing you’re right about is previous presidents SHOULD have addressed this but now that it’s happening, the ignorant want to complain. Just like complaining about cutting illegals out of social security so it can continue. Bet you thought he was cutting that and education.

There's only one thing that could possibly apply any pressure to Trump that he would take even remotely seriously.

Typically when a new administration comes into power it takes at least a year before anyone is talking about a reckoning happening during midterm elections. But take a look at what happened the other night in that special election in Wisconsin. This is typically a fairly evenly split state in terms of democrat / republican votership. They held a special election with some republican judge that was backed by millions of dollars in Musk donations who ended up losing the vote by over 10% which is big in a state like that. This essentially amounts to a complete rebuke of the first 3 months of the Trump / Musk administration (lets be honest, this is what we should be calling it now).

If congressional republicans start worrying about losing a massive number of seats in similar fashion at the '26 midterms you can bet they'll be calling up 1600 Pennsylvania avenue to complain about what's happening. And just maybe if enough of them complain Trump might finally realize that has to back off of this utter insanity that he has created.

This is basically what I'm hoping for at this point. There's not much hope for anything else."

And balance of trade is entirely unrelated to tariffs. They have no tariff that he's talking about.  

We buy cheap shirts from Cambodia and they can't afford to buy ANYTHING from us.  They're a very poor country.

The principle that Trump has been screaming since the 80's is simply wrong, and no one in the world believes it other than him.

You buy from Safeway, Safeway doesn't buy from you.  That's a ""trade imbalance"" but that doesn't mean that Safeway cheated you out of the money you bought things with.  But according to Trump's ""reasoning"" they cheated you out of all of your money and should be ""retaliated"" against!

Being a ""Republican"" shouldn't mean that you believe the dumbest nonsense in history just because Trump screams it.  You should actually read what I wrote, and it wasn't about trade barriers, it was about making stupid shit up and imposing huge tariffs over lies.

Trump is probably going to try to replace the IRS with tariffs that will make the country very very very poor and are based on stupid lies.

Though there's always the headlines claiming that ChatGPT came up with Trump's plan, but I don't believe that.  Even malfunctioning computers make more sense than this does!"

Some schools might specifically make students take a personal finance and an economics course, whereas when I went to school we had to pick 1 of basic economics, basic business, or a college level microeconomics class. In any of these classes, some of the current topics in economics are covered at a surface level, while other schools might spend much more time on it.

There are so many people who tried to save us from this, I’d put teachers near the top of the list."

comment,ml8msed,StockMarket,Did you say thank you?,Significant_Ad_4063,,3,"As someone who heavily traded oil that pissed me off beyond belief to see people attributing gas prices to ANY US president. Probably feel passionate since I deal with it a lot. 
But oil prices are reliant on really one thing: OPEC and their current goal.
Taking it all the way back to Obama, fracking becomes legal and promoted in the US, for the first time in many years America can produce oil at a cheaper price and take a profit, about 40-50$ a barrel, an opportunity to regain a place amongst oil exporters, help the US oil producers grow, etc. 
The reason why the US couldn’t before is simply because of OPEC who were created to oppose the US monopoly, and having vastly superior reserves of oil priced in the cost of a barrel at a level the US couldn’t compete with, effectively making sure the US was out of the market.
When fracking came, OPEC did the same thing, flooded the markets with oil, causing the price per barrel to go down to $40/barrel, exactly what it cost to produce it for America, which obliterated the US oil production industry. Some people celebrated low oil prices when others were losing their jobs, businesses and investments from it.
Then Ukraine war comes around, OPEC probably figures, we had to tighten our belts for the last few years, so here’s a little bonus check now that the 2 million barrel supply from Russia is barred from the markets. They could have definitely helped western nations, they were pleaded and asked to by many of them, but OPEC was created to fuck with the west so ofc they didn’t really give a damn. UAE pretended they sorta did but really was just a power play between them and Saudi for more influence over OPEC. 
Not Obama, not Trump, not Biden - just fucking OPEC.  And maybe Trump will figure something out, likely with dealing with Venezuela reasserting Maduros hold, potentially a deal with Iran though doesn’t seem like they’re interested at all after all the alienation, oh and yeah droning one of their top officials likely didn’t help. 
But up until now, Trump has been taking credit and blaming others (Biden) for something that is completely out of his hands, and if he did manage to make a deal with OPEC, I’d want every American to seriously ask themselves the question: at what cost?
But to me that whole “I vote trump bc of oil prices” just highlights the degree of complete ignorance and lack of care to try to understand how the world works from his voters."

comment,ml8xcb1,StockMarket,Did you say thank you?,Significant_Ad_4063,,3,"No worries, I see your 17 and from Canada so makes sense, we all start somewhere.

Very simply it’s a performance index that tracks the top 500 US companies publicly traded on the stock exchange, accounts for about 80% of the total us market, so a good indicator of economic trend! 
I believe in Canada the equivalent would be the TSX index, which I think just means the Toronto stock exchange index.

Their are many others for the US, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, NYSE index, Nasdaq composite, Russel 2000, etc that will use their own metrics to try and track the economy and stock market and most countries have their own.

Like China/hong Kong is the Hang Seng, Germany the DAX, France the CAC40, Japan has the Nikkei, and so on and so forth.

It’s often said that the stock market is ahead of the economy, so taking in that rule the index should likely forecast economic trends"

These people are being swallowed by the media so badly.

1. Let it be known that the market was due for a correction regardless, pretty much every single tech company was overvalued and everyone knows this.

2. Trump is going to either be impeached or continue to tank the market leading to hate and protest before he corrects it or backpeddles.

Eventually though someone else will come in office and save the market since it benefits them. Zero sense from people fr. I’ll continue to stack my bags and wait for a recovery while everyone moves to bonds with a regretful taste in their mouth in the next 5 years as they switched allocation at the worst possible time.

It's comes from the place in a lot of people that finds the idea of an evil plot hatched in secret by a bunch of evil overlords is more comforting than the idea that there is ABSOLUTELY NO CORRELATION between intelligence, competence, and power.

If Evil Overlords are trying to engineer a crash, at least you know someone is in control. It becomes a story, like in a book. And in books, the bad guy always loses in the end.

In reality you have 500ish dipshits and true believers Yakity-Sacks-ing themselves through a 3 stooges routine that's going to murder everyone's retirement fund and make Ramen Noodle cost 40 dolllars a bag.

If the Overlords are just trying to buy up stocks at a discount, well...they need the markets to go back up eventually, right?

If Jimmy the Dipshit who Failed Highschool Econ is making foreign trade policy by using ChatGPT, there's no limit to how deep the bottom can go.

Intentionally crashing the economy doesn’t make sense if they are trying to increase their net worth. If they are trying to increase their net power, it makes perfect sense."

Reagan did it in the '80s against Japan, and it worked. We're not trying to end global trade—just shift it away from enemies like China.

Tariffs can be targeted or waived for critical resources.

We're not trying to make everything here—just rebuild key sectors and rely more on allies like Mexico and Canada.


It’s not isolation—it’s smart independence.

My thinking right now is capital will want a rules-based, economic safe-haven to park. A lot of places in Europe will fall on hard times, with or without war. Germany is in a demographic tight spot for example. France looks okay though. Maybe there are companies to navigate there. Something something defense stocks. Should have invested earlier maybe though.

With re-militarization I was wondering if EU would stay together in the long-run. But with US being assholes and Russia being complete fucking bastards, they might hold together their alliance out of self-preservation. But a newly militant Germany that will probably have economic collapse in the next 10-20 years with alt-righty stuff going on is a wild card for sure. It might be tricky to navigate. If US could get their shit together capital could come back, but I think we've started a long-arc away from the US, at least. China will fall on hard times. US probably really benefitting from no clear number two option right now."

This statement alone means you are not.  Sadly.  
Its not that people are stupid.  I think people are willfully ignorant as a means of coping.  Its mass disassociation.  When you feel powerless to make any changes, and your fed a constant slop of propaganda, its easier to eat it up than it is to be critical and engage, and research, and think about things.  
Change is HARD.  Changing yourself is hard, changing your community is harder, changing the US is even harder.  Its much easier to live in delusion that nothing is your fault, and by extension nothing is your responsibility."

It's brainwashing. MAGA has evolved from a movement into a cult - it can happen to the most intelligent people. Plenty of Nazis were highly intelligent, rational people - enough so that they were at the forefront of landing men on the moon - yet they were more than willing to let Hitler lead them into what was essentially a cult of hatred. People live in an echo chamber. You think FOX is reporting on the negative impact of the tariffs? No chance. These people have been told so many times that Trump essentially is the pathway to victory they literally CAN'T believe otherwise, unless they are VERY open to changing their views. When you are only told the same thing over and over, it becomes ingrained into you."

The most positive comment for Dems there was something like ""yeah, Dems are meh at business but Republicans are so bad with like the gay people that I'm probably not going to vote"". I still don't get it. And the best thing is that they probably don't even know what Trump's economic policies actually are.

There is one thing I can't say about Trump and that is that he lied about what he was going to do. He lied about the results of course, but not about the policies he wanted to implement. All of this tariff stuff was said repeatetly during the campaign. Plenty of people warned about this. I guess voting for stuff that will hurt you is fine if that means 3 trans althetes can't participate on sports and the ""ilegal aliens"" are scared when going out?

Also, remember how the same markets that were overjoyed with Trump getting elected now realize that they literally supported higher taxes (which is what tariffs are in practise btw)."

You’re right—costs won’t drop just by moving industry back. But the point of “short-term pain” isn’t to save money—it’s to gain control.

From steel to semiconductors, we became dependent on countries like China and Vietnam.

You can’t expect real economic recovery without rebuilding our foundation.
That takes time—because we’re undoing decades of bad policy, not just one bad administration.

Now, for the first time in decades, we’re talking about bringing it all back.
Manufacturing, energy, rare earths, defense industries. That’s how we build real, lasting value again."

McKinley’s assassin was a pissed off anarchist who was radicalized by the panic of 1893. Ironically McKinley was shot during a public speech he was giving laying out a departure from his high tariffing policies, rejection of protectionism, and a new fondness for free trade. 

Even back then tariffs were strongly opposed and used on the campaign trail to great effect by democratic candidates back in 1890. McKinley lost his seat over it, it was a landslide year for the Democratic Party."

comment,ml7222v,StockMarket,"This time will be different, right?",formlessfighter,,2,"people who push this line of thinking are intentionally only looking at 1 side of the coin here...

the US has been offshoring jobs since the 80's. that's over 4 decades of corporations shipping jobs overseas to other countries to take advantage of cheap labor, and because of that everything is manufactured in other countries and imported here

that imbalance of imports is called the trade deficit and it has been growing precipitously for decades. *""In 2024, the US goods and services trade deficit reached a record $918.4 billion, a 17% increase from 2023, driven by surging imports and modest export growth"" - Google* 

All these people who never even heard the word tariff before are now coming out in droves against tariffs, but they don't even understand what is going on...

Look at the decline of the middle class in the USA since the 1970's. Look at the wage stagnation in the USA since the 1970's. Look at the growth of wealth inequality in the USA since the 1970's. All of this is because corporations have continued to offshore manufacturing jobs to other countries for their cheap labor and zero regulations. It has hollowed out this country and more people live in debt and poverty now in the USA than ever before.

Every single person complains about this. Everyone complains that wages have not kept up with inflation, that they cannot afford to buy a home and live on a single person income anymore, everyone complains that the rich have too much and everyone else has too little. 

But nobody wants to actually change that by reversing the policy of offshoring jobs and reducing the trade deficit? This is how stupid people are today... Classic reddit behavior here. Nobody is smart enough to even act in their own interest anymore."

From 1920 to 2020, industrialized countries' tariff policies evolved significantly, affecting global trade:

1. **1920s–1930s**: High tariffs and protectionism, especially during the Great Depression, led to a decline in world trade.
2. **1940s–1960s**: Post-WWII, countries started reducing tariffs through the Bretton Woods system and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), encouraging trade growth.
3. **1970s–1980s**: Continued tariff reductions, but non-tariff barriers (e.g., quotas, subsidies) rose. Global trade expanded.
4. **1990s**: The creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and regional trade deals further liberalized trade, boosting global trade flows.
5. **2000s–2010s**: While tariffs kept falling, protectionist sentiments grew, especially after the 2008 financial crisis, leading to trade tensions (e.g., U.S.-China tariffs).
6. **2020s**: The COVID-19 pandemic caused disruptions, with some countries prioritizing self-sufficiency and resilience over global trade."

comment,ml7b9q3,StockMarket,"This time will be different, right?",Macaroon-Upstairs,,1,"The claim that the U.S. enacts mass tariffs every hundred years and each time it leads to a depression is a clever take, but it’s not entirely accurate. The Tariff of 1828, known as the ""Tariff of Abominations,"" did cause political turmoil—especially in the South—but it didn’t trigger a depression. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930, however, is more relevant; while it didn’t *cause* the Great Depression, it certainly made things worse by stifling global trade and escalating retaliatory tariffs. As for 2025, while we’re seeing a rise in protectionist rhetoric and proposed tariffs, it’s too early to say what the economic impact will be—there's potential for disruption, but also arguments that targeted tariffs could strengthen domestic industries. So while there’s a grain of truth to the cycle idea, it oversimplifies a much more complex economic history."

comment,ml8l6oo,StockMarket,"This time will be different, right?",Wonkas_Willy69,,1,"We live in a time where a rando on the internet can say whatever they want knowing their base will NOT fact check it. 

Tariffs have been a constant tool of U.S. economic policy from the founding through the 20th century.

There were far more than just three “mass” tariffs… just a few examples:

-Tariff of 1816 (protective measure after War of 1812)

-Morrill Tariff (1861) during the Civil War

-McKinley Tariff (1890) and Dingley Tariff (1897)

-Fordney–McCumber Tariff (1922) before the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff

Tariffs were the primary revenue source for the U.S. government before the federal income tax (1913).

1828 Tariff of Abominations was highly protectionist and did create major tension, especially in the South (leading to the Nullification Crisis). It did not cause a depression, but did fuel sectional conflict.

The 1929 stock market crash and banking collapse were the primary drivers of the Great Depression. Smoot-Hawley (1930) deepened global economic contraction by sparking retaliatory tariffs."

comment,ml5v6wl,StockMarket,"This time will be different, right?",scumbagdied,,-12,"Okay, let's break down the claims in the image:
 * Claim: ""We've done this mass tariff thing 3 times in American history. 1828, 1930, 2025.""
   * 1828: True. The Tariff of 1828, often called the ""Tariff of Abominations,"" enacted very high protective duties on imported goods.
   * 1930: True. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 significantly raised tariffs on thousands of imported items.
   * 2025: Misleading/Speculative. As of early April 2025, there hasn't been a single, defining ""mass tariff"" legislative act enacted in 2025 comparable to the specific acts of 1828 and 1930. The tweet likely refers either to tariffs implemented in the preceding years (starting around 2018 under the Trump administration) or to proposals for significant future tariffs discussed during recent political campaigns (like potential broad-based tariffs). It's not a historical event that has already occurred in 2025 in the same sense as the other two dates.
   * Only 3 times?: Oversimplification. The US has enacted numerous tariff laws throughout its history. While 1828 and 1930 represent particularly significant and controversial examples, they aren't the only instances of major tariff legislation.
 * Claim: ""All spaced about 100 years apart...""
   * 1828 to 1930: 102 years apart. Accurate.
   * 1930 to 2025: 95 years apart. Roughly accurate, depending on what ""2025"" is referencing.
 * Claim: ""...because everyone who remembers the last one needs to be dead for the next one to happen.""
   * Opinion/Commentary. This is a cynical observation about societal memory and repeating history, not a verifiable factual statement.
 * Claim: ""The last two caused a depression.""
   * Tariff of 1828: Debatable/Oversimplification. While the Tariff of 1828 caused significant economic hardship, especially in the South, and contributed to the Nullification Crisis (a major political conflict), historians generally do not cite it as the sole or primary cause of a nationwide depression.
   * Smoot-Hawley Tariff (1930): Misleading. The Great Depression began with the stock market crash in October 1929, before the Smoot-Hawley Tariff was signed into law in June 1930. Most economists and historians agree that the tariff did not cause the Depression, but it significantly worsened it by provoking international retaliation, reducing global trade, and hindering economic recovery.
In Summary:
The tweet correctly identifies two major historical tariff events (1828, 1930) roughly 100 years apart. However, it oversimplifies US tariff history, misrepresents the timing and causality of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff relative to the Great Depression, makes a debatable claim about the 1828 tariff causing a depression, and presents ""2025"" as a completed event rather than ongoing policy or future proposals."

comment,ml9bkc6,StockMarket,"This time will be different, right?",Swimming-Telephone-1,,-1,"That is not true. The leading causes of the panic of 1893 were:

1)Sherman Silver Purchase Act (1890):

This act mandated the U.S. Treasury to purchase a large amount of silver each month, which led to a decrease in gold reserves and concerns about the ability to redeem currency for gold. 
Over-Expansion and Speculation:
During the 1880s, there was rapid growth and speculation in industries like railroads, which were financed by massive debt. 

2) European Recession:
A recession in Europe, particularly in France, England, and Germany, led to a contraction in international trade and investment, impacting the U.S. economy. 

3)Agricultural Woes:
Agricultural prices declined, and farmers faced difficulties in repaying debts, further straining the economy. 

4) Collapse of the Silver Industry:
The oversupply of silver due to the Sherman Silver Purchase Act and the collapse of the silver industry in Colorado and other states also contributed to the panic. 

5) Railroad Failures:
The bankruptcy of major railroads, like the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad, further rattled investors and the public, triggering bank runs and business failures. 

6) Bank Runs and Suspensions:
Fearing for the safety of their deposits, people began withdrawing money from banks, leading to widespread bank runs and suspensions of operations. 

7) Unemployment and Economic Depression:
The Panic of 1893 led to severe economic depression, with high unemployment rates, business failures, and social unrest. 

Prior to taxes being levied against Americans, following the ratification of the 16th Amendment in 1913,  the government generated revenue using the following:

1)Tariffs:
These were taxes on imported goods, and they were a major source of revenue for the federal government, especially in the early years of the nation. 

2)Excise Taxes:
These were taxes on specific goods, such as alcohol and tobacco, and they provided another significant source of revenue. 

3) Land Sales:
The sale of public lands also contributed to government revenue. 

4) Other Sources:
Other sources of revenue included customs duties, earnings from the Federal Reserve System, and various fees and charges."

Most our public school learning is rote memorization, and you can literally see it in our history classes. We learn an event happened, say President William McKinley's assassination in 1898. We would learn it happened, and if your teacher is ambitious, we would learn the name of the assassin. If learning this is the subject of a day's class or a five minute lesson is the teacher's choice. It is a tossup if your classmates actually retain the information or act like it's the hardest thing ever.

We wouldn't learn of the Panic of 1830, let alone it was caused by tariffs, that's economic stuff, and our high school/school system thinks it is too high-level for us. So we go on believing one of our presidents was shot with no cause.

comment,ml75lwh,StockMarket,"This time will be different, right?",Flipperlolrs,,1,"Right, the tariffs certainly didn't help but they were not the cause. This time around, the tariffs are much larger and spread out across all imports from our closest trading partners. This isn't a carefully targeted tariff on one industry to promote local growth. This will likely be disastrous on the same scale of the Great Depression even though the causes are quite unique from each other."

comment,ml5bz3o,StockMarket,2 trillion liquidated in roughly 20 seconds as Trump announced tariffs,JaxTaylor2,,18,"Nasdaq Composite Growth During Трамп’s Presidency

Трамп was inaugurated on January 20, 2017, and his last day in office was January 19, 2021. Here’s how the Nasdaq Composite performed during his term:

	•	January 20, 2017: 5,555.33
	•	January 19, 2021: 13,197.18

Percent Change Calculation

Percent Change = ((Final Value - Initial Value) / Initial Value) × 100

= ((13,197.18 - 5,555.33) / 5,555.33) × 100

= (7,641.85 / 5,555.33) × 100

= 137.6%

So, during Трамп’s presidency, the Nasdaq Composite increased by approximately 137.6%.

It’s still significant, but it’s not 155%. He literally just makes it all up."

comment,ml6uif6,StockMarket,2 trillion liquidated in roughly 20 seconds as Trump announced tariffs,Icy_Programmer7186,,1,"Okay, let's look at the performance of the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite indices during full presidential terms, measuring from the closing price on Inauguration Day to the closing price on the last trading day before the next Inauguration Day.

Based on percentage growth during their entire time in office:

1. **Bill Clinton (January 20, 1993 – January 19, 2001):**
   * **S&P 500:** Grew approximately **208%** (from \~436 to \~1343)
   * **NASDAQ Composite:** Grew approximately **311%** (from \~674 to \~2774)
   * Note: This period included the massive Dot-com bubble build-up.
2. **Barack Obama (January 20, 2009 – January 19, 2017):**
   * **S&P 500:** Grew approximately **181%** (from \~805 to \~2264)
   * **NASDAQ Composite:** Grew approximately **285%** (from \~1441 to \~5540)
   * Note: This period started near the bottom of the Great Recession market crash, providing a low base for growth.

**Conclusion:**

Based on these two major indices, the US stock market saw the highest percentage growth during the presidency of **Bill Clinton**.

comment,ml734u3,StockMarket,2 trillion liquidated in roughly 20 seconds as Trump announced tariffs,ColdEvenKeeled,,1,"Here is why the stock market is in the red. 

Supply lines have been built, factories created with local government incentives and maybe free land in developing world countries, the workforce is inexpensive and flexible, they are efficient and they generate their products. The logistics of getting these goods to US consumers are known and orders are in. These tariffs not only make these goods more expensive, it places a burden on companies to buy expensive land in the USA, with local nimbys resisting new factories, and now they must try to hire inflexible and expensive workers. The workers, to buy the products, will need to be paid very well. Resources to make things in the USA just grew 25 per cent more expensive and foreign purchasers are cancelling orders for American goods.  

None of this pencils out. The companies, responsibly to shareholders only, will simply retreat and shelter themselves from obligations and liabilities. 

Americans need to know this is a tax on you, you'll pay it to help corporate America rebuild factories in America, which will not make any economic sense to their shareholders, so they aren't going to do it anyways. 

Much of the fact American companies offshored factories to Asia in the mid 80's was due to a) alliance building at a political level to counter the USSR and China b) logistics such as bigger ships from better ports with more containers at cheaper cost from Asia c) a quite obvious desire for more profit from new factories and cheaper labour. The American unionised workers tried to make notice then, but were crushed with job loses. 

In the end, small countries need to protect themselves from US dominance.  Yet at this trend America will isolate itself away into a corner of the world and continue to eat like pigs,  demanding cheaper 'tribute' from all countries if they try to sell resources there. The other countries can trade with each other and craft a parallel development path of innovation. Bye America. Enjoy your big sloppy saucy greasy trough by yourself. China wins!"

All because the carrot that was dangled over their heads by foreign nations has now rotted due to Trump.

If we gotta suffer for a few years so we can thrive for many more, so be it. We will have our auto manufacturers back. We will have our domestic oil back, we will have our industrial manufacturing back.

And most importantly we will have millions of jobs back. 
So maybe after 4 years of rapidly rising cost of living under Biden you could have realized that it ain't a Trump exclusive thing. Biden was the one who screwed us. Trump is trying to fix it. And all you can find to do is to sit at your keyboard and consume as much propaganda as you can to distract you from the big picture.

*”The Dow Jones Industrial Average returned 56% during the Trump presidency, according to LPL. This represents an annualized gain of 11.8%, which is the best performance for any Republican president since Calvin Coolidge during the roaring 1920’s.*

*“This was still below the annualized returns of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama,” LPL’s Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick said in a January 2021 note.*

*The annualized return of the Dow was 12.1% and 15.9% for Obama and Clinton, respectively.*

*During Trump’s presidency, the Dow made 126 new all-time highs, which was slightly more than Obama’s 123, but still lower than Clinton’s 263. Both Obama and Clinton served two terms as president.*

*And since election day and up until inauguration day, President Joe Biden saw the sharpest gain on record in the S&P 500 of 12.8%, according to LPL. This compares to Trump’s gain of 6.2%, and the previous record holder of John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton, when the S&P 500 surged 8.8% between election day and inauguration day.”*

I think we will find that another massive transfer of wealth away from retail investors and into the pockets of fund managers took place this week.

It's infuriating to see Trumps propaganda team be given interviews on reputable business shows and paint this rosy picture without ANY pushback. I'm thankful that I don't give those liars any attention and listen to actual experts, but less discerning investors likely thought there was a 50/50 chance for the market to rally off of this.

Not listening to Trumps team of propagandists is quite profitable. I'm up 15% today.

So far, every earning play I have had, if I closed them the day before earnings, I was in the green. IF I sold them before earnings for profit, the value of my options rocketed after earnings. If I held, the stock did the opposite and I lost money.  Today my Rcat options are up a modest 10% or so. I am choosing to hold. So anyone who likes to inverse plays, Rcat is surely going to crater tomorrow as my 10% profit will turn into 90% loss."

1. see screenshots
2. speculative articles saying the following keywords: influenced, suggested, signaled
3. articles saying their earnings were due on 25 April 2025 and another due on 2 may 2025. so am i crazy or was exxon able to skip out on earnings amidst tariffs, opec ramping up oil supply??? Imk $xom

McCain is already far larger, they are just private so you don't get much news from them, but they have beat the crap out of LW by stealing retail market share in the US.

They may still tank due to continued poor performance from management - but the stock is also low enough that just a bit of good news could pump it. I'm conflicted on this one."

With the beating the stock has taken the last 3 months if guidance stays the same or increases the stock could double and would still be undervalued. However the stock is mostly held by retail who is completely clueless when it comes to interpreting ERs so I’d say 50/50 shot it tanks/rockets. I’d go call credit spreads if you wanna be bearish.

RCAT is probably the most comparable public company you can invest in to Anduril but they fill different niches in the drone industry. There’s also a bit of a 🥭 angle because Don Jr. is on the board of their sister company UMAC along with RCATs CEO Jeff Thompson.

I’m personally bullish on the report and have bought a small amount of calls to go with my shares but I’d be wary about making a big options play for next week. I think this stock is as close as you can get to a sure thing especially at this price, but since they rely on government spending which is controlled by some very unreliable hands right now, there’s no way to tell when that might be."

I don’t understand what the fuck is going on here. This is America’s Great Leap Forward. It’s one retard and a vision."

>The ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough.

That one sentence calmed markets instantly. No immediate action, just confidence and clarity. Investors stopped panicking because they knew the ECB had their back.

Now, Trump just slapped tariffs on basically every country. But the real issue isn’t the tariffs—it’s **uncertainty**. No one knows how far he’ll go, or if this is just the start of something bigger. Businesses and investors can’t plan when the rules keep changing.

Draghi stabilized markets with words. Trump is destabilizing them with unpredictability. And for markets uncertainty is worse than bad news."

“White House officials have circulated internal talking points telling surrogates that President Donald Trump’s new global tariff regime should not be characterized as a starting point for negotiations, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.

As the world tries to make sense of Trump’s sprawling new import taxes, the administration’s internal instructions say advisers should characterize the tariffs as a response to a national emergency, rather than the basis for potential new trade talks, the people said. In addition to the talking points, Trump himself has told advisers the tariffs are not about setting up negotiations, two of the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.”

comment,ml9wrqu,wallstreetbets,"What Are Your Moves Tomorrow, April 04, 2025",Tommysynthistheway,,14,"So [**iPhones are set to cost roughly 43% more**](https://www.reuters.com/technology/will-trump-tariffs-make-apple-iphones-more-expensive-2025-04-03/) if Apple fully passes the cost onto consumers. Thing is, passing higher costs on consumers could significantly slow down demand, especially a demand that’s relatively elastic like that for smartphones. 

So it’s a lose-lose situation for Apple as profit is thinned either way. But losing market share can become a long-term condition via a positive feedback loop once consumers migrate to other alternatives."

comment,ml98obv,wallstreetbets,This morning NASDAQ dropped more than during Lehman Monday,DonutsOnTheWall,,40,"Nobody causes a recession like I do. Believe me. Biden’s little inflation? That’s child’s play. Under me, we’re going to have the **biggest**, **most beautiful** recession you’ve ever seen. People are saying, “Mr. Trump, you can’t just slap tariffs on everything and expect it to work.” And I say, **watch me**.

We’re bringing tariffs back, big league. China? 200% tariffs. Mexico? Tariffs unless they pay for the wall again. Canada? Tariffs for being too polite. Wind and solar? Tariffs. I’m even considering a tariff on electric vehicles just for looking smug. I created something called recursive tariffs — tariffs on tariffs. It’s very technical, very innovative. Economists are crying. That’s how you know it’s working.

Markets? Crashing. Jobs? Evaporating. But you know what? Manufacturing is “coming back,” at least the headlines will say so while the Midwest burns. This is going to be a **real** recession. 2008? That was a warm-up. I’m thinking more like 1929, but with better branding.

People will be broke, yes — but they’ll be **proud**. Because we’ll be **winning**. Nobody else had the guts to tank the entire economy in the name of patriotism. I’m bringing back pain. And the Dow? It’s going to look like a ski slope.

So load up on puts. SPY, QQQ, TSLA — doesn’t matter. If it moves, short it. If it doesn’t move, short it anyway. You’re not just trading. You’re making history. We're going to Make America Crash Again — and you’ll thank me for it."

comment,ml7w5kk,wallstreetbets,This morning NASDAQ dropped more than during Lehman Monday,Oleg_Ribarcuk,,-11,"That is because different groups have different ideas on what a healthy economy looks like. Just because things were going along does not mean that the real economy was moving in a positive direction. The part of the economy that you are interested in, and that is ""green arrow goes up"" is propped up by the USA military and diplomacy. But those things need a real economy behind them so they can maintain the current power balance or at least not let it be altered in a dramatic fashion. If that real economy stops existing in any meaningful capacity, then the military and diplomatic force will lose power and then you are going to have a much major crash. The decline has already started at least a decade ago, and can be seen in the diplomatic sphere. If US sanctions were once a death kiss, now they are nuisance which any country with a healthy administration can easily bypass. 

Another thing is that it is stupid to think that Trump just suddenly started this entire thing by himself. From the ease whith which he is pushing all of his projects this term, unlike the last term. It can easily be deducted that there is some kind of a major power base which has agreed with this measures and thinks that it will work. 

So finally they are doing a hail marry to try to change the direction in which the USA is moving, and there is a pretty big concensus on that from the top levers of power because there is no real push back. Whether it will work or not is debatable and history will be the judge. But the current course the USA was taking is not sustainable.  Crypto bros, only fans hoes and a service based economy can not maintain a military which is the only reason why the economy can function in the manner it is. If it wasnt for the USA military and diplomacy you would be sewing t-shirts for 1000 dollars a month."

Asset values have been all out of whack since 2021.  We even had some small bank failures in early ‘23 to give us a clue, but that shit got patched over really quick.

We’re overdue this correction.  It’s painful, but ripping off a 20 plus year bandaid is just going to be.  Now, to see if Mango has the balls to see it through.  We already know that Corporate America and the consumer doesn’t have balls."

Elon Musk is rich... relative to what? He is relatively just as rich compared to Jeff Bezos today as he was yesterday. You and I are still rounding errors to them. 

There's a growing recognition that we're no longer functioning under capitalism and more techno-feudalism. The $x doesn't matter when you've positioned yourself to collect all of it. 

So no, the rich dgaf about share price because they own so much more relative to anyone else that the fluctuation doesn't change a thing. Even big market makers and hedge funds are so invested in each other that it doesn't matter.

The National Emergencies Act requires committees to report a bill to terminate a national emergency within 15 calendar days after its introduction and referral, and a floor vote on passage must occur three days later.  Congress (Republicans) change a procedure to read as this “Each day for the remainder of the first session of the 119th Congress shall not constitute a calendar day for purposes of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act with respect to a joint resolution terminating a national emergency declared by the President on February 1, 2025.”

I was super confused because he had to use the excuse of a fentanyl emergency to tariff Canada, and didn't realize he made up a totally bogus emergency yesterday to cause what is arguably a real emergency today.

See in his first term he declared a trade war on China and fucked over the farmers who ship shit like beef and soybeans over there, to the tune of billions of dollars, with buttfuck tariffs and terrible trade deals.

He pretty much destroyed agriculture in the US to the point that the government had to bail out the farms to keep them afloat.

And what happened? These same farmers he destroyed, then bailed out with taxpayer money, sucked his wrinkly little cock in 2024 and voted for him again. ""Yay daddy Trump, paddle my ass again, I'm a little farm boy!""

I think he realized he can do that with the US economy as a whole and no one will stop him. 

He's going to destroy SO MANY businesses with his horse shit tarifs, and then he will give subsidies and bailouts to anyone who bends the knee and sucks his dick.

It's like clumsy extortion - ""Nice business you got here, be a shame if something happened to it. But just pledge loyalty to me and I'll throw you an economic life line. I'll essentially give you back the money I stole in tariffs. Say thank you."""

comment,mlbc5dp,wallstreetbets,This morning NASDAQ dropped more than during Lehman Monday,DangKilla,,5,"Seven Bankers of Russia a.k.a. “Semibankirshchina:

In the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia’s economy was in chaos. A small group of very rich and powerful businessmen—mostly bankers—gained huge influence over the Russian government. These men became known as the “Seven Bankers” (Russian: Семибанкирщина).

Who were they?

They were oligarchs who:
	•	Made fortunes by acquiring state assets during privatization.
	•	Controlled banks, oil, media, and other vital industries.
	•	Had close ties to President Boris Yeltsin.

Why are they important?
	•	They helped Yeltsin win re-election in 1996, using media and money.
	•	In return, they gained even more power and influence.
	•	But their control made many Russians angry—they seemed like puppet masters over the state.

Enter Putin:
	•	In 1999, Vladimir Putin was chosen by Yeltsin’s circle as his successor.
	•	But after gaining power, Putin turned against them.
	•	He stripped oligarchs of political influence.
	•	Some (like Berezovsky and Gusinsky) fled or died under suspicious circumstances.
	•	Others (like Khodorkovsky) were jailed.

The Seven Bankers were ultra-rich kingmakers in the 1990s who helped shape modern Russia—but Putin crushed their power to centralize control under the Kremlin. Today, oligarchs still exist, but they serve the state."
comment,mlb0hq4,wallstreetbets,This morning NASDAQ dropped more than during Lehman Monday,TheStumpyOne,,2,"It's creating a harder space for people without billions so that they have to then sell their share of what they have to people who already have a larger share. It's not about simply profit, they want everyone else's piece of the pie.  

It's about getting further ahead of competition and plucky up starts not about simply making profit. It is not enough for these people to succeed, they can't have the next big thing taking away what they have. This environment makes it harder for people who don't already have capital to increase their Capital share."

comment,gle4vfc,wallstreetbets,Times Square right now,Pakoe91,,971,"**Get ready for FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) campaigns on the weekend. It's already starting.**

The  number of posts with supposed  ""level headed"" advice about how a short  squeeze is much more difficult  to achieve than we all think, how other  stocks are also valuable, and  how the strong and powerful hedge funds  have much more cards up their  sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but  still ""Go GME!! I am one of  you guys!"", always with a few rewards  sticked to them, is exploding and  will be getting progressively worse  in the weekend most certainly.

Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.

Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your GME shares.

ALWAYS   check the up / downvote ratio and read the comments before getting   swayed by whatever semi correct sounding bullshit they're spouting. Oh   how desperate they now have become.

I LIKE THE STOCK.

This is not financial advice. I eat crayons.

Usually a short squeeze happens over the course of a day or two. But this one is different. This has turned into a series of smaller short squeezes. They know most of us are expecting the traditional, obvious mega- squeeze, so the funds and other pricks are disguising their short covers - doing it slowly. They think the longer they do that, the lower our PT will be because we will begin to think the squeeze isn’t coming.

 But as the price is 🚀 they are also putting in new shorts (including new people doing the same). rationally, which we know nothing about, it’s a sound bet at this point, but we hold all the 🍌. 

So keep holding, the squeeze has not squoze, but rather the squeezes have begun squizzin. Keep fucking holding.

When hedge funds pull out of MSFT, it'll come down, algo trading will sell off more and there will be at least a flash crash. IF YOU ARE NEAR RETIREMENT AGE YOU NEED TO MOVE YOUR IRA MONEY TO BONDS IMMEDIATELY. Wait out the GME situation, if GME moons the market will crash and you can buy back in, if GME emptys all of our pockets then just buy back in. There's no risk to getting out now and sitting in bonds for 3 months.  Clear out your non-gme positions for bonds."

**On behalf of all fellow introverts, lurkers and silent observers - I just want to say we on this with you** 

Given all the activity this sub has seen lately, this may get lost into oblivion and that's okay.

Let me start of by saying that my account is only a few days old - in fact, I only created an account when WSB temporarily went private. However, Reddit has been my staple for information, jokes, wholesomememes, motivation, nsfwgifs and a lot more for more than 6 years.

And, I just want to let you know I am holding on to what little I've got, praying, cheering for you all and supporting in my own way. I may not afford to buy a billboard or a fly a plane to express my feelings - I may not even have the smarts to write a witty meme or two. Hell, I don't even know how to add those clever ""diamond hands"" icons (can someone teach me?). But, I can assure you that I've got your back. WE, have your back.

The events that've transpired from the past few days had made me realise that now might be more important than ever for me to write this - although it has taken me a thousand edits to conjure these few simple words.

AND, I am certain there are many like me who may not post about how many stocks they've bought, how much they've lost or gained and how excited they are to go to the moon and beyond, but I can can assure you they are holding.

WE are with you on this, though you may not see us. WE are with you on this, though you may not hear us shout. WE are with you on this all the way.

Good luck and god speed.

PS: This is not a financial advise (it clearly isn't) and not not a financial advisor (I am clearly not). So, do what you heart tells you to - play games, watch a movie or type an email on your phone."

Various sources have vastly different figures...Unless I am reading incorrectly, it looks like some hedge funds/institutions have closed their short positions since the overall short % is down.

Yahoo Finance say the short interest is 37.24%.

Finviz say 41.91%.

Highshortinterest say 78.97%.

Am I comparing like for like? Or does this feel off...

Now we all observed a lot of moves done by the suits past week and we are going into a new week with potentially a serious battle ahead! I very much need to add some fucking wrinkles to your otherwise smooth brains. Everyone's got guns, but do you have bullets? Well, here is some good ammo for you!

**Anatomy Of A Short Attack**

Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.

**Typical tactics include the following:**

Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.

The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.

By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.

Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.

Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:

**Media Assault -**

The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the *Wall Street Journal*, *Barrons*, the *New York Times*, Gannett Publications (*USA Today* and the *Arizona Republic*), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.

Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

>When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.

[VIDEO IS RIGHT HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI&feature=emb_logo&ab_channel=dehurlock)

Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.

**Analyst Reports -**

Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned ""friendly"" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.
