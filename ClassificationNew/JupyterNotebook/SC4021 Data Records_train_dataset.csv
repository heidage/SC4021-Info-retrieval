Currently on vacation which has been nice but I also miss the fast paced nature of my work. It’s been good in the sense of being able to look into some companies I’ve had on my watchlist/looking into the last little while. Figured I’d make a post and see if I could get any more insights on em.

&#x200B;

So the company is called Critical Metals Corp and they just rang the Nasdaq bell and are going under the ticker CRML. They’re aiming to be the first local lithium supplier in Europe to turn into an integrated battery supply chain.

&#x200B;

They also have an MoU with BMW to supply them with all of their zone 1 mining production. Including a $15M USD pre payment… has anyone seen this happen for other companies before?

&#x200B;

Anyway, if anyone has insights or has done DD on them before lmk. Anything is well appreciated. Time for the pool lmao","Hey guys!

So she has me going with her to the store and picking up the most obscure things. Sometimes they are good and some not so good. She recently had me pick up this environmentally friendly cardboard packed water called Flow water. To be honest it was a little more expensive than traditional water but it really was good (i'm a big water drinker) and if it's better for the environment that's just a bonus. But I started to think of the price vs the cost to make.

So I looked into the company more and found out they were traded publicly on the TSX. Curiosity got the better of me as I started looking into their PR’s and saw they had massive revenue increases as well as a recent partnership with Live Nation. But I concluded they were making a ton of money and definitely tasted a lot better than Dasani or Aquafina.

I haven’t told my new girl because she got me hooked on this stuff and I kept making fun of her for drinking water out of a box.

If you think this is a bad idea or have any advice, lmk why and if I should invest in something else like some crypto. Since this is my first time investing and I'm kinda young, I don't want to put too much money in. Should I put double and spend $500, or start with $250 and see how I do from there?",0

How well do you know international trade? This whole tariff debacle is about goods, because the US consumes wayyyy more goods than it produces. BUT. The US is a surplus
supplier in services. It is royally fucked if other countries start replacing US services with services from elsewhere. 

Americans so often believe the world needs them more than they need the world and it’s wild. It’s a truly interdependent system.
 
Also, one of the reasons the US has accepted higher tariffs on some goods until now is due to its favourable negotiations on the supply of services. 

Further, the reason for the 90 day tariff pause on some nations is due to other countries completely screwing your bond market, which will tank your economy faster than a trade war. China is one of those countries. For a country with much higher debt than most others, the US is incredibly susceptible to movements in the bond market; which makes it dependent on countries who hold bonds.

I understand the education system in America has been degraded over decades. But it’s so tiring coming on here and reading half ass ignorant comments. It’s ok to not understand this stuff. It’s not ok to just go ‘but murica is the best’. You’re not. You’re borderline third world at this point and the rest of the world is moving on without you. Sort your shit out already.","Hello!

China is a whole different ball game. The US depends on them much much more for a lot of the affordable day to day items Americans use and need.

**Time is against Trump. China will not make any attempt of communication until Trump backs down. He has to. THEY KNOW THIS.** Once basic day to day goods are not stocked / start rising in prices dramatically, people will get very very angry, including his supporter base.

Trump has to concede first by announcing the removal / significant reduction of tariffs. This will make him look like a pathetic, weak loser to his own country and to the world.

I guarantee you he is having sleepless nights at how calm and calculated the Chinese response is. Unlike others, there is no panicking. They are not rushing to have talks as he probably expected.

**⬆︎11.65% GameStop**

**🛎️ Earnings report - GameStop knows what its investors want. CEO Ryan Cohen’s latest move to revive the struggling video game retailer is putting its $4.8 billion cash reserve into Bitcoin—following in MicroStrategy’s footsteps. (**[**CNBC**](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/25/gamestop-says-it-will-add-bitcoin-as-a-treasury-reserve-asset.html)**)**



**⬆︎5.25% Nintendo**

**Rumors are flying that the video game company could launch the Switch 2 as soon as June. It’s the updated version of its hugely successful Switch console, first released in 2017. Some reports say a full reveal could happen as early as next week, and investors are expecting big sales. (**[**Sherwood**](https://sherwood.news/tech/nintendo-shares-soar-as-buzz-builds-amongst-gamers-and-goldman-sachs/)**)**



**⬆︎3.08% Dollar Tree**

**🛎️ Earnings report - The discount retail chain is selling off Family Dollar for $1 billion, nearly a decade after buying it for $9 billion. The chain never quite fit in and struggled to compete with bigger players. Investors seem relieved to see Dollar Tree cut its losses and refocus on its core brand. (**[**Yahoo**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dollar-tree-stock-jumps-on-1-billion-sale-of-family-dollar-154733182.html)**)**



# Stock losers



⬇︎**5.58%** **Tesla**

**Canada froze millions in EV rebates for Tesla and banned the company from future incentive programs.** To make matters worse, new U.S. auto tariffs were announced right after the market closed, adding more pressure to the broader auto sector. ([IBD](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-trump-trade-war-retaliation-canada/))



⬇︎**5.97%** **Nvidia**

**Nvidia’s H20 chip, designed to meet U.S. export rules, may be shut out of China’s data center market** because of new energy-efficiency standards. Chinese regulators are urging local tech firms to avoid chips that don’t meet the criteria. Nvidia might adjust the chip to comply, but it could come at a cost.

Trump is the epitome of the Republican Party, the most honest representation of the political far-right in living memory. That is why he is immensely popular, the more he destroys the US government, the happier the oligarchs and the Republican base is.

You have to figure that the GOP has been electing criminals for the past 80 years. Richard Nixon was first elected to Congress in 1947, was in the White House as VP in 1953, was nearly president in 1961, and both he and his VP from 1969 to 1974 occupied the White House. Instead of going to prison for life for their crimes, both the Republican president and vice president got to walk away scot-free. In 1973, the GOP engineered a coup to install another VP to become president to ensure that all future Republican government officials, all of similar criminal intent, are allowed free regain to never face any sort of criminal justice for their crimes.

It's kind of easy to see how Gerald Ford, a guy never voted into the White House, could be the worst US president in history. In the typical Republican gaslighting way, ""for the good of the people"" was the rallying cry to let these criminals, the highest elected officials in the land, walk away without life terms in prison. The exact opposite is true, and the US political center and so-called ""left"" as well as the world as a whole has been paying the price since.

In the immortal words of Michael Bolton (Office Space, 1999), had Spiro Agnew and Richard Nixon spent the rest of their lives in a ""federal pound-me-in-the-ass prison,"" the US would not have had this never-ending, long line of far-right-wing criminals in federal, state, and local government positions, fleecing and living off taxpayer dollars (and by extention other nations all across the globe).

But here we all are, living the Republican dream with the dream Republican president.

Or, to put it another way, if you were not already expecting this, then, as they say, you haven't been paying attention.","That's not really a question now, is it.

Trump is the epitome of the Republican Party, the most honest representation of the political far-right in living memory. That is why he is immensely popular, the more he destroys the US government, the happier the oligarchs and the Republican base is.

You have to figure that the GOP has been electing criminals for the past 80 years. Richard Nixon was first elected to Congress in 1947, was in the White House as VP in 1953, was nearly president in 1961, and both he and his VP from 1969 to 1974 occupied the White House. Instead of going to prison for life for their crimes, both the Republican president and vice president got to walk away scot-free. In 1973, the GOP engineered a coup to install another VP to become president to ensure that all future Republican government officials, all of similar criminal intent, are allowed free regain to never face any sort of criminal justice for their crimes.

It's kind of easy to see how Gerald Ford, a guy never voted into the White House, could be the worst US president in history. In the typical Republican gaslighting way, ""for the good of the people"" was the rallying cry to let these criminals, the highest elected officials in the land, walk away without life terms in prison. The exact opposite is true, and the US political center and so-called ""left"" as well as the world as a whole has been paying the price since.

They've recently announced plans for a significant drilling campaign at two of their key projects in the Eastern Athabasca Basin of northern Saskatchewan. Here's a quick rundown:

* **Russell Lake Project**: They're gearing up for a 5,000-metre diamond drilling program over the next few months. This is quite a large-scale operation, considering it'll cover ten to twelve holes. What's more, this project is strategically located near Cameco's McArthur River Uranium Mine.
* **Moore Uranium Project**: After wrapping up at Russell Lake, they're planning to drill an additional 3,000 meters in eight to ten holes at their wholly-owned Moore Project. The focus here is on high-grade uranium, which is pretty intriguing.

The combined drill campaign across both projects totals 8,000 metres and is fully funded. The company seems confident in the discovery potential at both sites, especially given the high-grade mineralization in historical drill holes.","Hey everyone, just came across some exciting news from Skyharbour Resources Ltd.

And no, the 1/1/1 portfolio is a standard recommendation for set and forget investors, investing internationally is not new, except maybe to people who have never consulted any source except reddit. 

Just ask yourself some common sense questions:

1. Assuming it's 2045 and you have no idea what market conditions are like, do you think it's smart to put 100% of your money in one country and 0% in the rest of the world? If so, why? 

2. Looking at the short/medium term, the US is highly overvalued, currently in the 98th percentile. When you do the math, it's more expensive to buy 80% of the US than it is to buy every other company in the world combined. Some of your individual picks drag you into even more extreme territory? Does that sound like a good deal to you? Why or why not? 

3. Why did you ask for advice on this thread only to react negatively upon receiving the feedback you were presumably seeking. Could you make a thorough argument as to why 100% US is a good strategy, and if so, what is that argument? Would you be confident recommending this allocation to a friend or family member? If you were hiring someone to invest your money, would you hire yourself based on that reaction? If not, who would you hire?

4. Your portfolio is heavily concentrated not just geographically, but also (albeit to a lesser degree) by sector. What justifies that allocation?  

5. Your past investments are not relevant. The fact that you got RR at X price will never help or hurt you at any point in the future. Why did you mention it? Are you confident that this wasn't an emotional reaction? 

Unfortunately ""I'm right and everything else is temporary noise"" is not a rational argument. You either have strong reasons to maintain this portfolio or you do not. That was true a year ago and will be a year from today. Your money is yours to lose and you are not obligated to invest rationally, but very simply it is extremely difficult to see the rationale for this portfolio even discounting the individual companies and any medium-term trends. 

Take a couple of days and put your rationale into writing - geographical allocation, responses to 5-10 year trends, sector allocation, each individual stock etc. Write the strongest possible counterargument to your own justifications, and adjust where you feel your reasoning is weak. If you're going to lose money, it's far better to do so with a strong thesis than it is to lose your life savings because you were too proud and wanted to prove to some stranger on the internet that, apparently, international investing is a week-old idea, the south will rise again, and hell will freeze over any day now.","You need to stop listening to the noise and think with your own brain bud.

For example, during the last couple of months, I have been working on 2 different portfolios.

The First is a dividend king portfolio with a high dividend yield and the second one, is a small group of equities that would call ""Deep Value"".

If this plays out the same way, the next step is that we all learn that it was a perfect plan but it was intentionally derailed by the radical left and the deep state.

In the UK we had politicians with enough sense to remove her. If no-one steps up in the USA then there's no saying where it goes next.","We had something like this with Liz Truss (with help from Kwasi Kwarteng) in the UK but on a smaller scale.
