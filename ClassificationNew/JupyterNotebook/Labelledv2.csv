Wealthsimple intentionally trying to avoid paying out Promotion,1jeeiu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wealthsimple/comments/1jeeiu9/wealthsimple_intentionally_trying_to_avoid_paying/,"I registered for the Winter Promotion for a iPhone or Mac with Wealthsimple and then initiated an institutional transfer to achieve the qualifying amount.  Since then I have had to chase up Wealthsimple multiple times for the transfer to actually be done.  I have also been told on three separate by Wealthsimple support that I didn't register despite the App clearly showing I am registered and that the institutional transfer wasn't a qualifying transaction despite the App clearly showing it is.  The qualifying period for the promotion is now over.

Has anyone successfully gotten Wealthsimple to pay out for Promotions before?  At this point it feels like I'm being gaslite by Wealthsimple to avoid paying out.

Update:  
I had someone from Wealthsimple reach out to me.  They told me that I could put the money directly into Wealthsimple as a deposit since the institutional transfer wasn't working and that they would make an exception to make it qualify.  There was also confusion as I used the term Winter Promotion for iPhone or Mac which wasn't the official name they had so the reps just said I wasn't qualified.  The guy who reached out said they should have just looked at what I was registered for.

What are the tangible benefits Merrill has over Fidelity?,1eh804l,https://www.reddit.com/r/MerrillEdge/comments/1eh804l/what_are_the_tangible_benefits_merrill_has_over/,"I recently started investing and I have around $5000 in my IRA. My primary bank is BoA and I actually like them a lot so I chose Merrill without thinking too much when selecting my brokerage.

But one thing that irked me initially was that I could not buy more expensive stocks and ETFs and would have to save up for it. Recently, I found out fidelity offers zero-commission fractional trades. I researched a bit more. EVERYONE and their mother recommends fidelity for a plethora of reasons (though some may not be pertinent to me).

I have some really broad questions. Is Fidelity worth switching over to from Merrill primarily for the ability to purchase fractional shares? What benefits does Merrill have over Fidelity for beginner traders like myself?

I'm still with CS because thinkorswim keeps me there. There is a learning curve, but it's one of the best out there. Significantly better than Active Trader Pro, which is what I assume you were using with Fidelity.

Second recommendation might be Webull. The desktop trading platform is smooth and responsive, unlike the .NET framework of ATP and old java of TOS (thinkorswim).

Here is my rating list, if you are curious. TD Ameritrade would have been the only one in S tier, but they got bought out by CS. I have current accounts at all of these except for Tradestation (closed it out last year).

S Tier: Fidelity, Charles Schwab

I'm so angry at eToro,1h4mz5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Etoro/comments/1h4mz5z/im_so_angry_at_etoro/,"A few months ago, eToro closed my account. Their stated reason was that I was temporarily living in a country where they do not have a license to operate. Even after I explained that I would not make any trades while staying there, they still proceeded to close the account.

I primarily hold crypto altcoins like XRP, Cardano, and others. During the market downturn, the value of my portfolio dropped by 50%, from $17,000 to $7,000. Now that the crypto market is rebounding, with XRP selling at $3, my $17,000 would have tripled in value!

I feel like this giant company treated me as though I were a tiny, insignificant critter.  So, learn from my mistake, don't hold it in one nest, find another trading platform, diversify!

(edit) Yep, it's my fault i couldn't help accessing the platform, I thought my citizenship covers my ability to access it outside or 'domiciled' but here's why they closed my account fyi:

I fully understand that eToro has the right to decide where they operate and who they serve. But what I’m pointing out is how **an online platform**, which promotes global accessibility, can seriously screw over customers with how they handle situations like this.

Closing an account completely—without clear terms specifying how long someone is allowed to temporarily reside abroad—is how companies end up blindsiding or outright screwing their customers. A read-only restriction or some other less drastic option would have been a more reasonable approach. Instead, they chose the nuclear option, which feels like an overreach, especially since I’m not asking them to break laws or operate where they’re not licensed.

So no, it’s not hard for me to understand their right to operate as they choose—it’s hard to accept why anyone would defend such a tone-deaf way of handling customers.

Or is all of this done automatically for you at WS, and you never need to track anything?

Also, if you do your taxes through WS as well as investing, does that make it easier (do they integrate better than doing taxes elsewhere)?

Lastly, if you do the above (invest and do taxes at WS), does it complicate things at tax time if you have investments elsewhere (Questrade for example).

Basically, if it's more complicated than a GIC, then I start to have heart palpitations.

>One final caveat about the superficial loss rules in the context of identical properties and index funds or exchange-traded funds. In 2001, the CRA stated that, in its view, index funds from different financial institutions are considered to be identical properties if they track the same index (say, the S&P/TSX composite), so simply selling one index fund and replacing it with a similar one from another issuer could trigger the superficial loss rules if it hasn’t been at least 30 days.

Both VFV and ZSP track the S&P500, so selling one and buying the other within a 30-day period can prevent you from claiming capital losses. You'd have to use funds that track different indices, like VFV (S&P500) and VUN (S&P Total Market), to avoid this issue.",-1,AugustusAugustine,4,1742101923,2025-03-16 5:12:03,16 March 2025

PSA on the Big Winter Bundle Promotion,1jj4299,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wealthsimple/comments/1jj4299/psa_on_the_big_winter_bundle_promotion/,"This is a PSA and maybe even a rant on the Big Winter Bundle promotion. I’m using hypothetical amounts because I don’t want people knowing the amount of money I have.

 I registered for the promotion and transferred a $40k RRSP to Wealthsimple. However I recently got an email saying that I would need to maintain $80k in my account in order prevent my bonus from being clawed back. 

I thought wtf? Why do I need to hold $80k when I only transferred $40k as part of the promotion? Turns out that they include ALL the money you’ve deposited into Wealthsimple in the minimum balance, including different account types like TFSA and others. I had a $40k TFSA that I was using to save up for a down payment which was included in the minimum balance.

So, if you have any amounts in any type of accounts in your Wealthsimple profile prior to the promotion, ALL of that would then be restricted to withdrawal, unless you want your bonus to be reduced. 

When I read the T&C’s for the promotion it did mention that your starting net deposit prior to registering for the promotion will be included in the minimum balance, but I thought it meant any net deposits in the SAME amount type! Meaning if I had an existing RRSP with Wealthsimple (which I didn’t) that any amounts in that account would be included in the minimum balance. But turns out it was for all account types. 

If I knew this, I would have transferred my TFSA out of Wealthsimple prior to registering for the promotion and transferring my RRSP in, because I need to use the money in the TFSA for a down payment in a couple months! But now because Wealthsimple did not make it clear, I cannot withdraw any of my money in my TFSA without having my promo bonus reduced! Wealthsimple support has been unhelpful with clarifying. 

I don’t know if other people were aware of this which is why I’m writing this PSA in the hopes that it helps other people. 

",mjn7y7e,Wealthsimple,"Yeah. I get what people are saying, it makes sense that the net deposits would be across all accounts, but given that this promo has a specific registered investment angle, which are typically head for longer terms without withdrawls, I can understand why people like myself interpreted it differently given the long term holding nature of those investments.

During the last 1% promo, I had budgeted in a significant margin (ex: to buy a car, mortgage prepayment), working with a WS rep, so that my bonus would be calculated on a lesser amount. What I am curious is, if they are going to calculate the net balances across all my accounts at time of transfer in for the new promo, or in addition to the previous net threshold amount that I negotiated (and that shows up in the app). Not sure if this makes sense. I emailed the WS rep for clarity. If they were to remove my eligibility for the new promo, based on me withdrawing funds from my cash account (within the buffer of the original net proceeds), that would be very frustrating and I would definitely take my business elsewhere to take advantage of another institutions promos.",-1,nspace,1,1742906412,2025-03-25 12:40:12,25 March 2025

Condor Gold sold to Metals Exploration mid January and whilst I have been credited with the  cash  compensation of 9.9p per share I am yet to receive the Metals Exploration shares to my account. In fact, even though Condor Gold was delisted on the 14th January they are still showing on my IBKR account!

Despite complaining to IBKR that Metals Exploration shares should have been credited to accounts by now I just get the usual response that I simply must wait!  Its most likely my ignorance and that it does actually take 2 months for new takeover shares to be credited but the lack of customer support is driving me mad.

Can anyone shed any light please? is there any IBKR users who had Condor Gold in the same position? If its any use my Condor Gold shares were on the TSX as I could not buy them on the LSE.

"$50,000 stolen out of my 401k account and Fidelity refuses to investigate. 20yr customer.",1ie0crr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1ie0crr/50000_stolen_out_of_my_401k_account_and_fidelity/,"I discovered that I reported about $40,000 less income—approximately 15% of my total income for that year—on a tax return from two years ago after receiving a notice from the IRS. This discrepancy occurred because someone fraudulently took out a 401(k) loan in my name without my knowledge. They mailed a paper check, which was cashed by an unknown person. The loan defaulted after I switched jobs, causing the automatic payroll deductions to stop. Unfortunately, I didn’t closely check my pay stubs during my final months at the company and missed those deductions of $100 to $200 for loan repayments.

Fast forward ten months since I uncovered this situation, and I have been trying to work with Fidelity to resolve it. Almost a year has passed, and they JUST NOW saying they won’t investigate further because the check is too old. The entire process has been filled with nonstop delays. I’ve repeatedly asked for copies of the endorsed check and even had to fill out a notarized affidavit stating that the signature was not mine and that I did not receive the money. Despite contacting them more than a dozen times, I still have no clear answers on how this will be resolved. Eventually, I received news that their investigation team deemed the check too old to take any action. Now, there is $50,000 missing, and I haven't heard anything from their investigation team, even though I’ve been a Fidelity customer for 15 years and have invested millions with them.

I reviewed Fidelity's customer protection guarantee, and it seems like it should cover situations like this involving my 401(k) and retirement account. It feels like there has been a serious breach of contract here, and I honestly don’t know what to do next.

This experience certainly motivated me to raise financially savvy kids but all they seem to be interested in when it comes to money management is crypto trading and grabbing sign up bonuses everywhere like  [$75](https://www.gemini.com/share/7llnqkyhp), which is their latest favorite from Gemini

We are shocked to see that advisor sold the bonds but also WITHDRAW the whole thing into my mom's chequing account.

Best solution IMO is pulling up YouTube on your monitor/phone/ipad whatever and watch zendoo channel live scanner… I’m pretty sure it’s exactly what your looking for and has only a 3 second stream delay… all momentum scanners(up and down) and halt information which is really helpful during market hours.  

I usually check it in the evening also and plan out potential runners to look for the following day by creating a watchlist in TOS from what looks good to me based on float volume news and load some into charts if they look good and maybe draw some TA lines… then I wake up and confirm or deny / update my stuff getting ready for the open.

For example, let’s say I want a part of my paychecks to keep going to my current bank, but another part of them to go to Wealthsimple. (I’d assume a TFSA would be best to invest in long term but feel free to correct me.

Once the money is in my Wealthsimple TFSA, or other investment account, I want to use it to buy a good long term investment to earn long term interest, and profit when I retire. I’m thinking $500-1000 a month into the S&P 500 or something similar.  

I’m young so I have time to invest long term. If someone could give me a process and the steps on how they did this or how I can do this, it’d be a big help. And other advice would also be a big help.

Also I’m in Canada if that’s relevant.",mjv7f2v,Wealthsimple,"By the way, you aren't really earning interest when you invest in most ETFs like ZEQT. You earn dividends - that is the yield - which are payments made to shareholders from companies for performing well (usually). There is also a capital gain/loss, which is the difference between the share price when you sell compared to when you purchased.
Some ETFs like ZMMK and CASH.TO have distributions that are interest because they are like a high interest savings account. 
I mention this because account interest is considered safe - like a GIC, but the low risk means low reward.  Buying stocks can lead to losses or dividend cuts during market downturns (2008 financial crisis, covid, etc). The key is to NOT SELL so you don't realize the loss when this happens.

Fidelity holding transferred funds for 16 business days on HSA!,1i3rt2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1i3rt2g/fidelity_holding_transferred_funds_for_16/,"I am a long-time customer of Fidelity, and have always had my bank account linked to my retirement and HSA accounts held through Fidelity.

I called the number on the back of my card and was informed that the current policy is to hold funds for 16 business days!!! This is the most absurd thing, and the agent told me it was because of increased fraud. If fraudsters are trying to transfer money into my HSA, I say more power to them (joking, of course), but this sounds like an excuse for something else going on.

the fidelity agent, of course, mentioned I can “simply” reimburse myself sometime in the future (after they institute a hold on transferring that money back to myself). it’s horseshit. no small amount of interest or dividends makes a hold like that reasonable in any sort of way. it should be criminal, but this is the great ol’ USA so f@&$ consumers.",-1,bigguismalls,2,1737210299,2025-01-18 14:24:59,18 January 2025

Is this something that etoro detects? Or am I overthinking?",lru8hpf,Etoro,"Not sure about that but trading CFDs on eToro will lead you to lose all the traded funds over time.

So far, they get away with it sufficiently to make it a core part of their business model.

Most people find this hard to believe when it happens to them. Once it does, they get worn out by very streamlined, even if non intelligent, process run by their reps, which hand a client over to eachother continuously. Vast majority of people do not end up suing and they keep all relevant information on their end, so you are in adeliberately  exceptionally inferior position to take action.

I recently placed a somewhat large transfer to my brokerage account (>$10K <$50K), and they have frozen the funds until January 17th, which will be more than 6 weeks.

While I understand they have 'increased incidents of fraud' their approach does not seem to be logical or fact based.

Some things to consider:

My account is not new. 

The account I am transferring these funds from is also not new. 

I have made similar transactions between these same institutions in the past.

The total value of accounts owned by me is several times the amount that was transferred- holdings they could conceivably use to make themselves whole if it were, in fact, fraud.

While I am certainly not desperate, I am greatly annoyed that they would take such a nonsensical approach. 

It leads me to believe either their fraud problem is so bad that they don't care about alienating existing clients or their risk assessment process is completely broken.",m4v36zz,Fidelity,"""Push"" from the source bank side to Fidelity.  Don't pull from Fidelity.  Check deposits are considered a ""pull"".  Not always an option since banks can have stingy ACH transfer limits, but do it when possible.

I have noticed that I avoid the hold when the deposited check amount is a small percentage of the accounts total balance.  Depositing a $500 check into an account with a $2000 balance?  Hold.  $5000 check into an account with a $500k balance?  No hold.  So total amount of deposits doesn't matter as much as the account being deposited to.  That $500 check deposit is a small fraction of all of my Fidelity accounts, but if it goes into a small balance account, it gets a hold.

> It leads me to believe either their fraud problem is so bad that they don't care about alienating existing clients or their risk assessment process is completely broken.

These holds don't alienate me.  If I pull $50K into Fidelity, I get to use the funds immediately.  Even before the check clears.  I'm just restricted from withdrawing the funds.

When I took over as CEO, I laid out a plan to the entire Freetrade team with two key objectives:
Get Freetrade to a position of strength and, 
Create the future of Freetrade.
Thanks to the team’s hard work and grit, we delivered Freetrade’s strongest performance ever in 2024. That puts us in a position of strength to take our growth to the next level. 

Today, we’re taking the next step on that journey. 

I’m pleased to say that we’ve agreed a transformative deal to become part of the FTSE 250 fintech, IG Group.

The deal values Freetrade at £160 million which implies a share price of approximately £1.19. 

As part of the deal, Freetrade will continue to operate as a commercially standalone business and, together with IG, we will transform the execution-only investment platform market in the UK. 

Freetrade is in the best position we’ve ever been in as a business. We’ve just closed our best year of performance ever, with revenues up 32% compared to 2023, AUA of £2.5 billion, and £2.1 million of EBITDA. 

This is a transformative deal that recognises the significant value that we have created with our award-winning platform, simple design, fair and transparent pricing, and high velocity product delivery. 

I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for your contributions to our success.   

The deal is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals. Once that approval is received, we hope the deal will close in mid-2025. 

Those of you who hold options in Freetrade’s Global Share Plan or shares granted under the EMI, will be entitled to receive sale proceeds on closing. If you hold GSP share options then you will be paid through payroll where tax will be deducted at source. If you hold EMI options these will be paid by the paying agent we have appointed (Wilmington Trust).  

We will be in contact with optionholders over the coming weeks with further information.

Years of experience by platform.

TD Ameritrade: 10+

e\*Trade: 5+

Schwab: \~3

Interactive Brokers: < 1

I really don't understand why Schwab is moving TD to the Schwab platform when the TD platform is so superior but the piece that I just can't get over is why Schwab didn't take the hover pop-up and move it over when they brought over ToS. That hover popup is so useful on decision making without going off platform. I do all of my screening and analytics with google finance and finviz so I don't need a replacement for that but I do need a data rich holdings platform.

I much prefer the e\*Trade holdings grid to the schwab so I would go there except the lack of the hover pop-up and really bad click through page is close to useless.

With the TD web platform I have everything I desire with the left side with the holdings and hover pop-up and the right side dock customized with all the broader info (news, markets, watchlists). As far as I can tell, no other of the big platforms allow any customizations beyond columns and column order. No widgets, or dock like info, no hover pop-ups with relevant next level stock info.

I like e\*Trade's options screen better than TD's popup but there doesn't seem to be anything better about Schwab on any matters of importance. 

I haven't found anything I like about IBKR.  It seems style over substance.

With 40 days left, I can't believe I'm stuck with Schwab abandoning the 9/10 platform and migrating clients to the simpleton app that works best for buy and hold investing.

Question regarding the process for completing a Roth conversion.,1h2hlkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1h2hlkf/question_regarding_the_process_for_completing_a/,"Question regarding the process for completing a Roth conversion.

I am 65, enjoy the work that I do, and plan to work until 67.  My retirement portfolio at Fidelity has grown to over $3M (97% tax deferred traditional IRAs and 3% in Roth IRAs).  My current salary contributions go directly to a Roth 401(k) with Principal and I will transfer these funds to Fidelity when I retire.  I am currently in the 22% tax bracket and expect to be in a higher tax bracket when I retire, especially when I begin taking RMDs.

So my plan is to begin Roth conversions to pay tax now at the 22% rate instead of a higher rate later.  Should have started sooner but this is where I'm at.  I don't have external funds to pay the taxes on the conversion so my intent is to pay the taxes from the traditional IRA withdrawal before depositing into the Roth IRA.  I have determined what my total income will be for 2024 and the total taxes.  And I have factored in the IRMAA threshold since I will begin Medicare in two years.

So my question is really the process for completing the conversion.  When I go to the Fidelity website and start the Roth conversion on-line, I am asked which account the money should come from and which account it should go to.  However, it does not allow me to withhold the taxes.  There is a note on the website that states if I want to withhold taxes from the withdrawal before converting to the Roth, I need to call Fidelity.  So I called Fidelity and they said I need to do the conversion in two steps.  The first step is to withdraw the funds from the traditional IRA, have taxes withheld, and put the remainder into my core account.  Once this transaction has been settled (usually in one day), I can then transfer the money from my core account to the Roth IRA.

While this process seems simple, the Fidelity rep seemed unsure of the process and had to put me on hold and ask someone else.  My concern is whether doing it this way would still be a ""Roth conversion"" or a ""Roth contribution"" in the eyes of the IRS.  I understand that a ""Roth conversion"" has no limits as long as I pay the taxes on the amount converted.  But if I do it in this two-step process would it be viewed as a ""Roth contribution"" and subject to the $8,000 contribution limit for Roth IRAs in 2024?

I plan to call Fidelity again on Monday and hopefully get a rep who is more knowledgeable on this subject.  I guess the key is how Fidelity reports this two-step transaction to the IRS. 

There is an incredible amount of knowledge and experience by the members of this group and I was hoping to hear what anyone else had experienced, especially from Fidelity users.  Appreciate your help!",lzrjbyk,Fidelity,"I'm in a similar situation and it took me a hot minute to get hold of someone at Fidelity to discuss it. Are you near a Fidelity office where you can schedule an in-person meeting to discuss? I would start there. That said, you really need to speak with a tax professional regarding the tax implications. While Fidelity can advise you on the investment piece, they cannot advise you on the tax piece.

Wealthsimple Tax Child Care Costs,1jugloz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wealthsimple/comments/1jugloz/wealthsimple_tax_child_care_costs/,"I have a question about 'Earned Income' and child care benefits when using the Wealthsimple tax filing. 

I withdrew RRSPs which is taxable income (Please don't lecture me on early withdrawal as it was pre-planned and part of my financial plan).

This puts me above my husbands gross/net income.

My total 'earned income' is less than my husbands when RRSPs aren't taken into account.

In a few places I've read, it notes that RRSP is not earned income but Wealthsimple tax is taking it as earned income and applying our child care expenses to my husbands taxes.... But technically should it not be applying it to mine since my actual earned net income is less than my husbands?

Has anyone else encountered this?

All-World ETFs,1jyzbcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/trading212/comments/1jyzbcx/allworld_etfs/,"Hi! I have been doing some very basic research on how to start investing and have decided to dive in. I am in my late 20s so a bit late in the game and I really have no education on the financial market or any of the jargon. Sorry in advance if the following is a really basic and silly question to ask here, but I'd really appreciate some help!

Some basic info: I am based in Europe and only have EUR bank accounts. I am only starting with 100 euros with a daily top up of 5 euros. Not a lot I know but I would rather start slow and learn than gamble it all. I have reached a decision of getting an All World ETF and see that there are multiple available to pick from. For now I will only consider accumulation types:

\- Vanguard FTSE (VWRP / VWCE / VWRA)

\- Invesco FTSE (FWRG / FTWG / FWRA)

\- SPDR MSCI (ACWI)

So now my questions are: 

1. If each provider have different options available (e.g. Vanguard has 3) and these options are all in different currencies, should I, being a person based in EU spending EUR,  be investing in the EUR one?

2. What is the difference between each option from the same provider apart from where they are listed (and therefore the currency used)? Do they give different yields?

Thanks in advance!!

",mn3qjjx,Trading212,"VWRP and FWRG track the FTSE index, whilst ACWI tracks the MSCI index. They’re functionally the same concept. The yields may differ slightly between the two indexes in the short term, but over time they should perform pretty much identically. There are bound to be minor differences in tracking and spread, but this shouldn’t really matter over the long term. 

VWRP is provided by Vanguard and is more well known, so tends to be popular for that reason, despite being a bit more expensive than the other two options. FWRG has a lower TER, and ACWI a lower TER again (although this was only reduced within the last year). At this level you’re pretty much splitting hairs, so either will be fine. I personally tend to sway more towards ACWI, purely for the slightly lower fees. 

You should generally always buy a fund in your home currency to avoid FX fees.",0,SomeWelshGuy,3,1744655230,2025-04-14 18:27:10,14 April 2025

How to know what the market will go?,1jln404,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkorswim/comments/1jln404/how_to_know_what_the_market_will_go/,"Hi guys. So I'm very new to trading. I have been watching videos and reading to learn  about daytrading. I want to ask you
 How do tou know if the market will go down or up? I know some people use indicators but is learning about all the indicators is the only way? Currently, I just watch a stock and buy when I think it is low enough.  sometimes it goes up and I sell at some point at a profit,  but sometimes goes down, and I keep the stock in that case until it goes up. But then this feels like gambling to me. Can you guys tell me how you foresee what will happen? Also do you keep an eye on the news or something and take action based on the news and announcements? ",mk62os2,thinkorswim,"A momo setup: look for news and adjust scanners. Watch target L2 with an eye on a 133 tick chart with macd and Williams percent and another eye one minute time chart.  If you can afford the service use a 10 second chart.  In and out of trades in seconds.

Everything happens on the L2 in near to real time as possible, all other indicators lag.  All. Control your emotional expectations in the moment. 

A day trade setup: pretty much same setup, a little less live L2 influence, more macd and percent influence, several charts from 5 minute to 30 minute are up.  Trades last from several minutes to hours.  

Swing trade, seasonal trade, buy and hold, dividends....  all have unique approaches to trading styles.  Ya really gotta trade paper for a few months to develope your own styles...

Lots of videos and training to be followed out there.

Why are you staying with Freetrade?,1ax93q9,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreetradeApp/comments/1ax93q9/why_are_you_staying_with_freetrade/,"I opened a ISA account with freetrade as Trading 212 paused new users signing up for quite a while. Been using freetrade ISA for almost 1 year, and I am planning to switch provider soonish.

My questions for all of you is that what makes you staying with Freetrade (ISA)?

My main complaints with Freetrade are:

1. Expensive comparing to Trading 212. High FX fees for trading Non-uk stocks.  £6/month ISA fees vs £0/month on trading 212
2. a lot less equities and ETFs on offer. over 6000s on freetrade vs over 12000s on trading 212
3. App lacks features and constantly malfunctions. currency exchange, demo account, after hour trading, copytrading etc for those who needs it. The features on Freetrade app is just very basic. Also Trading 212 has a much better desktop site than freetrade

I am not shilling for trading 212 at all, both products are directly competing with each others and have a lot of similiarities. In my opinion, trading 212 provides better value and product for investors.

What do you all think? is there any red flags about trading 212 i should be aware of before switching?

Edit: typo

Edit: for those who wonder if trading 212 has worse spread than freetrade, it really doesn't, the spread is either identical or slightly better than freetrade.",krml8tj,FreetradeApp,"I am in the same boat as you and I agree. The benefit of switching has outweighted the hassel.

Any thoughts on Merrill edge?,whjxtq,https://www.reddit.com/r/MerrillEdge/comments/whjxtq/any_thoughts_on_merrill_edge/,"I'm a BOA customer, platinum honor or something so in order to not move money out ( then I could lose the tier )  I was thinking of opening at Merrill edge but wanted to get some thoughts on this if this is a good idea?

I did my research and the Con said   

· Desktop platform doesn’t offer one-click buy/sell orders or conditional orders.

· High margin rates.

High margin rate for what? I'm only considering to do ETF but I think those are free buy/ sell?

Are there any hidden fees?!

Also what does it mean by doesn't offer a one-click buy/ sell? How many clicks do you need to make? or is it only available on the app?

I also heard it takes forever to get to the customer service rep ..

Any advice will be appreciated. Thank you\~",ij8k7yn,merrilledge,"I am mostly a buy and hold type of trader but I do sell from time to time. this is all my experience and I'll try to answer your questions


I joined as a gold member originally and up till now I have not dealt with any hidden fees. The fees are explained at the beginning. I would like to add a few points to this though.


• I have a taxable self account. There is the regulatory fee that you'll pay at any broker as it's a federal one; it's basically a 1¢ for most stocks sold unless it's a huge amount.

• If you also decide to buy foreign stocks, be ready for a withheld of X.XX amount when selling them or collecting dividends. Again this is basically every broker and it's a tax thing. 

• ETFs have a sell fee of 1¢ - 3¢ per $1,000 principal. Something people tend to forget after they open. I think this is just Merrill edge, not sure.


As a mostly buy and hold person, I do not need to dabble that much with the PC version. So I cannot comment on that. Other than that I like all the tools that are offered for researching stocks.


I can say that the mobile version is very barebone when it comes to trading but it has a quick buy and sell button. I find it significantly easier to place my buy order with a limit on Mobile. Just confirm the amount of shares you want, at what price, and how long to keep the order open. 


The margins are for people who are going to trade with debt basically. (More complicated than that) I don't mess with that so I won't comment on it.


I never had to call so I cannot comment on this either. I heard the war stories of needing to wait 3 - 5 hours though.


Here are some extra things I found nice to know.


• If you want to trade penny stocks then this isn't the broker for you. They black list so many penny stocks. I heard Merrill edge blocks companies that don't have a certain amount of capital.

• They also block certain covered call ETFs. Like NUSI is blocked but you can trade JEPI. I do not know what the criteria for these 

• You can't buy fraction shares, but you can turn on DRIP and have your dividends reinvest themselves if you choose so.

This was kinda long, but I hope it was helpful. If I got something wrong, I hope someone corrects me. If you have any other questions I'll try to answer them.

Best alternative to Schwab?,17sbe59,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/17sbe59/best_alternative_to_schwab/,"I was just moved over to Schwab and it is a horribly designed app and extremely difficult to use in terms of presentation of data.

Shadowing a trader in papertrading on TOS - how do you add a TP and SL to a trade,1hmqsup,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkorswim/comments/1hmqsup/shadowing_a_trader_in_papertrading_on_tos_how_do/,"Hi all, I'm a newbie to options and part of the way I'm learning is to papertrade on TOS following a trader's alerts. I know how to place a basic buy or sell order but I don't see how to put in the TP or SL.  Sometimes this guy does Iron Condors and an instruction today was to buy at 1.30 credit and then his alert will say 15% take profit = 1.10 debit or 100% premium stop loss = 2.60 debit.  Where am I filling these in?",m3w17n0,thinkorswim,"To add both a stop loss and take profit order to an existing position, use an OCO (one-cancels-other) order type.

Q3 and q4 of jet 2 will be something to watch.",ml8jmbm,Trading212,"I think this is wild.

Boycotts, 70% reduction in travel to the US, flights diverted away from active airspace that's a warzone, increase in high profile safety issues and crashes, an overall indication that the world is about to enter a period of conflict, increase in cost of fuel, increase in cost of materials to maintain planes, increase in cost of hospitality. Even before America there was a massive rhetoric in the med countries to lower tourism as it was harming the local populations. We've not even seen what the EU is going to do with reciprocal tariffs yet, they could absolutely fuck tourism with tariffs. Global warming....mate I could go on and on about why I'd imagine this to be a terrible idea.

You're also not just looking at the bigger picture here, even if we ignore everything I've said. Tariffs mean price increases. Price increases mean people have less to spend. When people have less to spend, they are less likely to go on holiday.

But overall, I just think nothing screams ""lads holiday in Zante"" more than World War 3.

Tiger brokers force liquidation,1jvkiow,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1jvkiow/tiger_brokers_force_liquidation/,"Hi, anyone encounter this before ?
They force sell most of my shares due to liquidity and today the market went up.
I lose close to 150k.

I want to hold and just lay back for a few years. Why they sell without informing.

Tried talking to the support but no one is responding.

Edit: thanks for all the reply. I should be more explicit. I know what margin is but it is the default account for tiger brokers. I treat it like cash.

One example, I have 1000 shares of Tesla bought at 380. I have close to 400k sgd and 100k USD in my account.

Tesla drop to 220 last night. I have lots of paper loss. Got liquidated the moment excess liquidity hit maybe -2300 ? 

I am asking if the calculations is fair. For those who trade long enough, you should also know they can change margin requirements anytime.
For my other stocks, they raise it to 80% from 50%

I am asking if this is fair. To just change on the broker whim. 

Edit 2 : https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/s/pxv5kfxqYx",mmbsmri,singaporefi,"I think you are using margin. so if you have 100k, please buy 100k SGD of shares, then you won't get margin called, if you buy even 120k worth of shares whatever is NOT your money, (20k) there's still chance of margin call. I don't think you can recover this loss easily, your best bet is to find another broker, without using margin, keep your remaining money and hope Tesla goes back down to that price in any volatility, and then buy in using full cash non margined.",0,wiltedpop,3,1744253799,2025-04-10 2:56:39,10 April 2025

For example, I miss seeing lists with detailed holdings, fundamentals, news, and just plain way more info that WS shows.  Especially the WS app vs the TD app on my phone.  WS seems to have so many clicks involved to see info, such as how much you're holding, charts that won't glitch out, performance viewing options, etc.  It's also hard to get as much information from quotes and watchlists etc.

Started Jan last year,1hmzhao,https://www.reddit.com/r/Webull/comments/1hmzhao/started_jan_last_year/,"Last year I cancelled all my subscriptions. Whoop, Netflix's, Hulu, x, just everything. It came out to a little under 300 a month. Then I took that and invested it in stocks on webull. Total I put in about 3600 and I have alittle under 15k. I'm going to start paying attention to what I buy now. If it's not something I need I'm going to take the money I was going to spend and throw that in webull along with the 300 a month.

How you can avoid the effect of Fidelity Deposit holds (if your account is big enough),1i5y5wx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1i5y5wx/how_you_can_avoid_the_effect_of_fidelity_deposit/,"**Either** of these should save you from the effects of the holds:

1. Don't deposit checks to Fidelity or use EFTs where Fidelity pulls the money. Instead use wire transfers or have the EFT triggered at your bank.
2. Deposit a taxable **margin account** with enough marginable securities held, **and** do not have margin debt protection (^(https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/margin-debt-protection)) enabled. During the hold period you will not be charged margin interest on the held amount if your check or deposit does not bounce. Downsides: you need a margin account with more than **$25k** value and marginable securities, and if you do buy more than your cash-equivalents can cover, you pay margin interest.

What would be nice, IMO, would be a condition where your holdings of investments could stand as collateral against deposits that turn out to be bad, even if the securities were in a cash account or  margin-debt-protection-enabled account. That way, Fidelity is protected, and you get the convenience of easy deposits. The downside is Fidelity would have another class of hold to keep track of.

PD as backup to MMF?,1clsrmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/MerrillEdge/comments/1clsrmu/pd_as_backup_to_mmf/,"Originally, I was just going to start slowly putting more money into TTTXX because I'm in state with income tax, but I wonder if it's worth just initially setting up PD as a backup HYSA in case things change in the future.

1) Once I deposit and money settles, is it confirmed that I can sell most of PD and put it into TTTXX? Is this still true, since I read conflicting info on this sub (Just keeping a minimum balance of like $1k)

2) I read TTTXX you can sell cash secured puts (I'm not this advanced), but is money in PD able to trade as well? (Just for my info, this is an emergency fund after all, not planning risky moves)

Whelp for those of us who cant get into TOS desktop lets have a talk about what our options are to trade?,1imaabh,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkorswim/comments/1imaabh/whelp_for_those_of_us_who_cant_get_into_tos/,"Right now the update has shut the door on anyone running an older operating system on PC and Mac  
FYI as of right now [min requirements on their site ](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim/download)says ""Windows 10 or later"", ""OS X 10.11 or later"" and ""Zulu OpenJDK 17 to run"" for Linux

Our options to trade are:

\- Mobile and web BUT you will not have access to any custom built scans, watchlists, charts

\-upgrade to the next avail OS and see if it works - NO Im not saying go through all of them its ridiculous, test it out see if you get lucky **and BACKUP your systems FIRST before you try to tinker with an upgrade**. (My Mac is maxed out I couldnt go past Catalina if I wanted to and my machine doesnt like Catalina, where I ended up having to wipe the drive and put a much lower OS on it where the machine runs absolutely fine EVERYWHERE else except now on TOS)

\- buy a new computer!!

Ive been told in the past when I had tech issues that ""you"" more or less need a gaming computer because of the load studies(lots of math) put on the processor/CPU. Many think you need a good graphics card/GPU bc if youre running a lot of charts each one is like a streaming a movie(imagine running 4-6 movies at once on your machine) thats true but the CPU is more important. I know this bc I literally swapped out my iMac CPU and all my problems at the time were solved!

So I guess where Im going with this post is how..where can you get an inexpensive gaming level computer?  
I see them listed on Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart... but which brands that sell machines less than $600 should you most definitely stay away from?  
Honestly abt 3yrs ago before I upped my CPU I got an ACER but problem I had was juggling between 2 machines at once, this machine is on this screen that machine is on that screen,  it was too much I sent it back 2 days after I got then did major refit on my Mac for abt the same cost as the ACER ($350) with the CPU and SSD replacing the old drive.

Any computer gurus our there care to weigh in??",mc8af6t,thinkorswim,"Thanks, yes I figured it had to do with Chromium, though that has been out of Win 7 support for over 2 years now and ThinkorSwim has been maintaining compatibility with no issues. It's not like the usability of Win 7 has decreased at all which is why this is so frustrating. There is still a vibrant community of users who refuse to ""upgrade"" and when I say everything works great on 7 that's an understatement. My current setup is the smoothest computing experience ever and all I see around me with newer OS' is a nonstop stream of time-wasting problems. All the other browsers are still receiving Win 7 updates: Firefox, Tor, and there are other forks of Chrome such as Supermium released as well as extended kernels which support Chromium. And even the applications that are ""unsupported"" still mostly work fine until someone intentionally breaks them. And it seems like that's what's happened here. I get it. Not worth it for them to maintain support with all those trivial updates they just have to push, lol.",0,salfora,2,1739300168,2025-02-11 18:56:08,11 February 2025
API Update,1bqv30q,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/1bqv30q/api_update/,"I received email today indicating the Schwab API is now 'open'.  Key is:

Existing TD Ameritrade API endpoints, while currently still available, will be disabled after market close on May 10, 2024.

Currently you need a Schwab account and given I can't create a Schwab login until April 9, this basically means I have 30 days to transition my existing applications to Schwab.

However, you can now at least read the documentation and am doing so now and will update the post. At first glance (brief review in 5 minutes), the API looks quite similar to TD, so suspecting they simply lifted the TD API (be kind, this is after 5 minutes of reading).

Depending on the API complexity, as I call the TD API via a centralized code base, whether I use a shim to simply update the function to translate td to Schwab. Have to see and will advise again.",kxli3ej,tdameritrade,"> Do you need to go through the trouble of getting an access token though for the /quote endpoint to work? 

Yes, you need an access token for all end points. 

>And if so, it'd be great if you explained a bit how to get an access token.

Authentication uses the OAuth 2 protocol. It's the same basic flow as the TDA API. There are user guides on the developer portal with more information.

In short, user authenticates using the Schwab login page and is redirected back to your app with a code, you take the code and get a refresh token and access token. The access token expires in about 30 minutes and you use the refresh token to request another. Refresh tokens are good for 90 days.",0,BrightTarget664,1,1712003344,2024-04-01 20:29:04,01 April 2024
Go to the Fidelity Investments Subreddit and Let Them Know that Blocking Access to Our Cash for 20 plus days is Wrong,1fukcqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1fukcqm/go_to_the_fidelity_investments_subreddit_and_let/,"It is a company controlled subreddit.

",lqdio70,Fidelity,"the fraud issue is simply overblown. think like retail stores where theft is a thing you simply cannot prevent completely. they call that ""shrinkage"" and that's why you have bored guards at entrances and little gate scanners and the like. it doesn't solve fraud but mitigates it a little. 

the same is the case with transfer fraud. it's a small amount of lost cash that the banks can fully absorb and put in their balance sheets as cost of doing business. 

meanwhile, the narrative of ""OMG fraud is eating the universe"" is a PR gimmick to mitigate lost revenue now that end users got wise to the fact that using a high yield money market account instead of a useless checking account is much smarter.

of course it also means that suddenly, less cash is available for fidelity (and its brethren) to generate yield with. at their scale that's billions of dollars of course. 

as long as people accept the narrative, things are fine by bankers. it's up to people to make them stop.

Shame on Fidelity,1fn6xi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1fn6xi4/shame_on_fidelity/,"Update: found out this morning this was a nationwide problem with Wells Fargo stopping checks for insufficient funds. 

Recently I withdrew money from my Fidelity investments, and was sent a paper check which I deposited. There was a large hold but also a large deposit showing in my checking account in which I paid several bills since the money showed AVAILABLE. Evidently, after a couple of days the check came back to the bank for insufficient funds from Fidelity. This caused an overdraft of several thousand dollars in addition to almost a thousand in fees. 

Fidelity told me this was a nationwide bank issue and to call my bank. The bank said this was a Fidelity issue and there was nothing they could do. I confirmed the money was indeed taken from my Fidelity account! After 3 hours on the phone, tears, anxiety and a near stroke Fidelity told me a representative with a special investigation dept would call me within 24 hours. It’s been 3 days and NO contact! I’m beside myself and plan on rolling  my families investments into another financial institution. Beware! This has been an absolute nightmare.

Options in practice:  sell call.,1jxm7cc,https://www.reddit.com/r/interactivebrokers/comments/1jxm7cc/options_in_practice_sell_call/,"Hi,

First of all: I'm not gambling with options. I use options to improve my trading strategy.

This is question just to help me ""sleep better"":

If I do sell call option of $AAAA stock (to keep this post with less as poss words I'll ignore step by step explanations) I'm aware of fact that in case of reaching strike price I'll need to give away my 100 shares and collect agreed strike price.

My IBKR account is fully activated with Options, so I can do naked options as well.

Question is:

Does IBKR system always checks if this exact stock is in my account? For example if above scenario WILL happen as a exchange, then shares will be passed to the other side contract trader. Always shares when I have shares or there is chance my shares will be untouched and ignored but used my money from the account treating it as naked one?

My attitude in here is to do as per above example, so I do sell call to give away shares. But I'm worried if system will ignore my 100 shares and use money instead. Is there any chance for this situation or all good? Anyone with experience in here? All good and I don't need to worry?

**EDIT:**

Thank you vacityrocker, Future-Warning-1189 and others for explanation, my matter is sorted then.

(I won't wipe this topic so others in the future can read in case of same ""problems"".)",mmrzaur,InteractiveBrokers,"In case you don't use ChatGPT, you should start. Here is the reply:



You're good. If you hold 100 shares of $AAAA and sell 1 call contract, IBKR will treat it as a covered call — not naked — and your shares will be used for assignment if the call is exercised.

💡 Here’s how it works:

If the call buyer exercises, IBKR will automatically deliver your 100 shares to fulfill the obligation.

It will not liquidate your cash or treat it as a naked call just because your account can do naked trades.

✅ As long as you hold the 100 shares in the same account and they’re not pledged or loaned out, IBKR will always prioritize using your shares at assignment.

⚠️ Just make sure:

You're not short the shares

The shares aren't being used as collateral for margin in a way that prevents assignment

You don’t close out the shares before expiration

So yes — sleep easy. If you’re selling calls against shares you own, IBKR will handle assignment correctly and use the shares, not your cash.",0,VoicesToldMeToSignUp,2,1744484093,2025-04-12 18:54:53,12 April 2025

My understanding was that a standard split is done by the broker’s accounting systems and just multiplies your number of shares. Whereas a dividend like the one GME issued means that the brokers have to receive the shares from the company before they can issue them to shareholders.

I made a mess with my Roth IRA backdoor conversion,1b41zcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1b41zcb/i_made_a_mess_with_my_roth_ira_backdoor_conversion/,"So I created a mess for myself with all the back and forth Roth IRA contributions, return of excess contributions and Roth IRA backdoor conversions. Please hear me out:

* Early 2023, I contributed $6.5K into my Roth.
* Late 2023, I got married which put my income above the Roth limit, but I didn't realize that until early 2024.
* Early 2024, I contributed $7K into my Roth.
* A few days later, I realized I wouldn't have qualified for Roth in both 2023 and 2024 so I took a return of excess of $13.5K plus earnings.
* A few weeks later, I learned about the backdoor method so I created a traditional IRA and re-contributed 2023's $6.5K into it by calling Fidelity and asked them to manually do it because the system already showed that I had reached my limit and only a live person could override that. My account now shows an excess contribution because the system was not able to reset the first $6.5K when I took the return of excess. Hopefully this can be explained as a technical issue on Fidelity's side.

https://preview.redd.it/yoiho8vnprlc1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e1926c88a272a94db9cf7e7051eaa955d4b85ee

* Today, I did a backdoor conversion of that $6.5K from traditional to Roth. However I just realized that even though I had until 4/15 to contribute, I only had until 12/31 to do the conversion.
* I did not re-contribute 2024's $7K yet.

The question is what will be my tax implications for 2023 and 2024? Should I reverse the backdoor conversion and let the $6.5K sit in traditional?

Thanks!

&#x200B;",ksy30hm,Fidelity,"If you really only want to contribute ultimately to a Roth, then the money you put into the Traditional IRA can be post tax (taxed already, not pre-tax or tax-deductible) and is not limited by your income. So, add as much as you want (non deductible) to the traditional IRA and convert it all to Roth. As long as you are paying taxes on the money you put in the Traditional IRA you don’t have to worry about income limits. At least that’s how I understand it. I think if you’ve reversed all of the direct Roth contributions, you should be good. But definitely ask a tax professional to be sure.",0,bobbysolar,2,1709345827,2024-03-02 2:17:07,02 March 2024

Thoughts on our local finance gurus?,1jvya9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1jvya9v/thoughts_on_our_local_finance_gurus/,"
Share feedback on our local finance gurus? Wonder if any have been complained in the recent 8 complains.

This market crash helps us see who are the ones who really know what they doing in the markets the influencers and YouTube guys. Some of my friends have sold in panic the last few weeks by following the wrong people. Told them don’t listen listen to these gurus. But there is good ones as well also please give credit if you know personally from your experiences. 

I think is time we really do a post on them which are the ones we can really trust or listen after this episode. 

Any comments about these people if you are their personal students or customers? Who se financial content help you? Open honest discussions.

I am aware about the hereditary issue and will perform and full body check before we have any offspring (it’s one of my condition as well prior to having any kids). I have arranged for specialist visit to see if there are any underlying condition. For future planning, for now, I am not ready to be a single mom, but I will continue to work as long as I can. We will have a discussion after the check up results to determine if it is wise for us to bring new life into the world. The last thing we would want is to burden our children if we have our own.

I was made aware that my partner has underlying health issues (albeit not life threatening now) but he’s been rejected from most insurers. 

He has an existing company insurance that covers up to 170K for death and TPD and that’s it. 

He’s looking to build a family, but I am worried, because he would be the main sole breadwinner of our household and I don’t know who/what we can depend on if anything were to happen to him. I am employed but I’m not a high earner and plan was to stop working once we reach two kids to raise them full-time. We do not have any legacy or generation wealth (parents are also sick and no insurers would take them).

Would you still build a family in this case? What are some things we can do to be able to cater to our (future) kids in the case we are gone? Buy more savings plan? Just focus on investing?

We have set aside monthly recurring investments and I have insured sufficiently for us and our home. Planning to add on term plan in the future.

I just stared the FI journey in the last 1.5years. Aside from 6-months of my base salary for emergency expenses (split between SSB and cash account) I have invested as much as possible in this early phase.

Now I see the portfolio drop about 30-40 percent of the invested amount. I remember reading about warren buffet and others sitting on cash waiting for a buying opportunity etc. I saw even FirePathLion calling it out in the yearly update. How do they do it?

My philosophy is - I cannot time the market, so keep doing monthly DCA. But in this last few months, I am facing even fundamental question as to is US market even the right place to accumulate? Seeing the actions of the current government- I am having lower confidence in US as a long term bet.

I have some investments in Endowus Prime USA, VWRA, and my RSUs from my
Job all globally dominated by US presence.

I wish to know what are the better things you have done to cushion yourself? I am a very passive investor- just DCA. How do you actively monitor the market to keep yourself protected in such situations? Or are we all on the same boat? Looking for some wisdom here. 

",mln81hj,singaporefi,"You said you're a passive investor, there is nothing that you should do/can do as big protection requires active management and all hedges come with a cost.

For active investors, there are tools like options, managed futures, inverse ETFs that can hedge or participate in the downside. All come with risks, costs and the need for market timing. 

Best you can do as a passive investor if hedging crashes is your concern is to invest in long dated bonds (can be done through ETFs like ZROZ, TLT) which often move inverse to equities, and use the appreciation in bonds to rebalance. Even then it's not completely passive unless your brokerage allows auto rebalancing. 

Endowus for example, allows you to auto rebalance if you have multiple funds in your portfolio, or use their flagship funds which already have it structured in various ratios.",0,Plane-Salamander2580,17,1743909851,2025-04-06 3:24:11,06 April 2025

TD API risk,1b3vz6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/1b3vz6b/td_api_risk/,"My acct is final batch to be moved on 10 May.  The API team, while responsive, have been less than clear on what happens to the API access on the day.  The documentation is now dated with last real update 1 year ago promising they were working on a Schwab API.

Given Schwab has no API docs and the website has not progressed and given the fuzzy response from TD on the API, I'm left conclude that perhaps TD will simply walk away from the API on the 10th. I can understand this as simply a business decision, who is using the API and how much in commissions is it generating. I have to presume only a small fraction of the TD base uses the API and perhaps an even smaller % use it for live trading. 

If my fears are indeed true, the question is who might you recommend as an alternative:

TastyTrade - I looked at their API and sadly it looks not very well thought out, doesn't appear you can get quotes without using some funky streaming service. Sounded like lots of work. But their client software is well done.

Tradier - seems to have a simple easy to use API, but their website and client look a little light in terms of capabilities.

The good thing about money market funds is that their target NAV is usually $1. So when you buy or sell, you don’t have to worry about a capital gain or loss. 

Also it take a day to buy and sell it which is a bit of a pain. Another option is to buy the SGOV or BIL etf. Both ETFs basically buy 1 month, 2 month and 3 month treasury bills. They also pay a monthly dividend. Their annualized yield is above 4%. I think their yield is a bit higher than than the treasury money market funds. Being ETFs they are tradable intraday so don’t have to wait like money market funds. The downside is that there could be a small capital gain or loss depending on the price of the etf.

My Journey to find a Broker other than Schwab,16vlchf,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/16vlchf/my_journey_to_find_a_broker_other_than_schwab/,"**Forward**: This describes my journey looking for a broker to replace my automated move to Schwab from TDA. These are my thoughts and opinions and I'm not endorsing (as in gaining any monetary benefit) any one broker or service over another.

**The beginning**: I was scheduled to be moved from TDA to Schwab November 3, 2023. I signed up for a Schwab account early and put $50 in it so I could use/try out the trading software.

AT first, I was OK being moved as we were told we would be able to use TOS. While TOS seems to now be available to Schwab users, I find that is just not enough to put up with their otherwise ""horrible software"".

**What I want in a broker**

To be clear about what I was looking for in a broker, I want high option level approval and good software, margin approval, fast trades, and a fricking interface to open into like the TDA start page (Good luck on that!).

Plus, the whole damn thing needs to be usable and not require 20 clicks to find watchlists, option tables (all of them - not just a few dates), my current investments and my net worth, and Hey Schwab! How about some colors - green for up, red for down, we would all really appreciate that! Needless to say, these things and many more features were available on the TDA home page.

**The Brokers I Tried - Not a rundown of all their features, just good and bad points.**

**Schwab** \- One look at their desktop trading and phone app and you start thinking that they cater to 90-year-old buy and hold customers. If they didn't grab TOS from TDA, I don't know how anyone could actually trade options with their software.

**Tasty Trade** \- **Good**: It works OK **Bad**: Didn't like the interface. It's too simple in some ways and too complicated in other ways - esp. the option screen.

**IBKR** \- I tried these guys a few years ago. My impression was they were like desktop TOS - the info is in there if you want to dig it out. I didn't want to dig it out - next.

**Robinhood -** I tried this because some of the TDA guys that were **""let go""** went to work here\*\*. Good\*\* It's simple\*\*. Bad -\*\* It's too simple and too many ads imbedded in the screens. One option lets you put emojis on your trading screen. Hmmmm.

**TradeStation - This is the broker I chose - HOWEVER -- see update below. The reasons:**

1. They actually have customer service you can talk to\*\*.\*\* Schwab was the only other broker you could call and talk to someone in a reasonable amount of wait time.
2. You can trade with them directly in the TradingView app. For some reason I have been using TradingView more and more - esp. since informed that Schwab wanted to annex my account.
3. I have option level 5 with them. They like me and want me to lose my money quicker.
4. Their web software can do everything I need it to do and is very similar to TOS web in function and appearance.
5. A so-so is their desktop app is similar to desktop TOS. It's there if you have the time and want to mess with it.

 **Update October 24, 2023** \- I moved my IRA to TradeStation about 3 weeks ago but I did not move my main trading account as I wanted to see how things worked at TradeStation. It only took 5 work days to transfer my IRA to TradeStation which was good, However, after using their mobile, web, and desktop apps, I am not happy with them. About the only advantage TradeStation really has over Schwab for me is a higher option approval level and that just doesn't make up for their sub-par software.

Currently, my main account will move to Schwab on 3 November. I am staying with Schwab as I can always do my options trades on mobile ToS - which is as good as any other mobile option capable app out there. I have some money at Robinhood and at IBKR, but at this time I don't see them as a destination for my main account.

I didn't realize how difficult it would be to replace TDA and after a month of searching I don't think its possible.

Good luck to all transferees. I hope you find or make a home as good as TDA.",k399eui,tdameritrade,"I hear you. It's very hard to be an active trader and have to change how you do things. On a positive note, I have re-examined my trading approach and have made some beneficial changes.

I don't call customer service unless I have an issue with my account. I would be happy if I never had to call them.  Transferring my whole trading account with several options and margined stock makes me want to talk to the people that I'm going to do business with.

Like you, I have to think more about how I want to do things and what button I'm pressing, and it is not the same experience I had with TDA.

I'll keep in mind what you and others have said about IBKR, but I'm done looking around, and hopefully can spend more time trading.

Advice for 39M,1jqbnul,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1jqbnul/advice_for_39m/,"Hi everyone! Would love to seek advice from experienced folks here on financial advice hence let me describe myself and my financial situation. :)

39M, single. Income is 9k but working in a startup in a volatile industry. 

Cash savings is 140k parked in a UOB One account with salary being credited there as well. 

Investments amount to 180k through various platforms - some unit trusts and IBKR. Locked in for the longer-term.

a. Prudential Whole Life Plan (one of the older ones that my parents set up) - 1.3k /year and valued at 90k.
b. AIA ILP - 6k /year and need to hold for 10 years minimum. Paid for 3 years already. Valued at 22k.
c. Friends Provident International UT - $750/month and need to hold for 25 years. 5 years in and valued at 42k.
d. Amundi Index MSCI World Fund via Endowus. Invested through SRS. Valued at 15.3k.
e. IBKR investing in 50% VWRA and 50% CSPX. Monthly DCA of USD$500 in each. Valued at 12k.

Insurance is amortized to about $280/mth. 

Own an old 4-room resale HDB with monthly housing mortgage at $2,041/mth (cash-topup is $487 and the rest is from CPF-OA).

Monthly expenses excluding insurance, investments and housing mortgage is about $2k.

In light of the recent UOB One account nerf, I am thinking of reducing the cash savings on hand. Unlikely to need a large sum of money in the short-term and perhaps a portion of the 140k cash savings for home renovations in about 4 years' time. These are the steps that I am thinking of taking and would appreciate any advice from the community. :)

1. Setting aside a lump sum investment from the 140k cash savings for a longer-term play. Where should I park in - platform and instrument and how much will be good to set aside?

2. Keep about 6 months of emergency expenses in UOB One itself (2.3% at below 75), or transfer to a MMF/safe investment option on a brokerage platform. Which MMF and broker is recommended?

3. What would you differently if you were in my situation?

Happy to furnish more details to get better advice as well. Thank you!",mle50qq,singaporefi,"If possible, try to exit your ILP  ifyou break even or lose not much. exit as soon as you can. Personally, I’ve never been a fan of ILPs—they’re not great products to begin with, in my opinion. Never buy insurance link with investments product.

For example (real case), a peron start investing in your mid-20s, a large portion of your premiums (say, 90%) may go toward investments, while only 10% covers mortality charges. But by your mid-40s, this could shift to 70% investments and 30% mortality charges. By your 50s, even less goes into investments, and more is allocated to mortality costs. Often, the investment returns aren’t enough to offset the rising insurance fees.

The situation worsens if you develop health issues like high cholesterol or high blood pressure. The insurer may increase your premiums or even decline coverage, leaving you with zero option, and stuck with an ILP you’ve paid into for 30 years—only to find it’s lost money at the age of 50s, that is what happened to a friend.

I’m also not a fan of unit trusts (UTs) due to their high upfront fees (3-4% or more in the first year) and ongoing management fees. However, if you have cash on hand and a 3-5 year investment horizon, you might find better returns in blue-chip stocks, especially in the current market ( masscare on the ""liberation day"" and today)",0,Wannaretirerich,1,1743781894,2025-04-04 15:51:34,04 April 2025

Arguably how 'Free Trade' apps like Robin Hood (and possibly FreeTrade) make they money.

Front-running is trading stock by a broker who has inside knowledge of a future transaction that is about to affect its price substantially.

Say a broker gets an order from a  client to buy 1 shares of a company.  The broker sets aside the request for a minute and first buys some that share for their own personal portfolio at a cheaper price than you've ordered. Then the client's order is put through.

Opening account for child,1d6ge2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/MerrillEdge/comments/1d6ge2a/opening_account_for_child/,My 17 year old daughter is getting her first job this summer. Can she open an account and begin putting money in? We are only talking $50 a paycheck or so (bi monthly pay schedule) so is there a better way or just put the money in and buy in small chunks?,l6s9pv4,merrilledge,"For her to open an account in her name, she would have to be 18.

Now, there are custodial accounts that can be opened with you as the custodian and her as the ""minor"" or ""beneficiary"" depending on what type of account you open. 

However, these accounts have very strict rules and are more of a headache than I think is really worth it. Custodial accounts are for the minor and once those funds go in there, they belong to the minor and cannot be used by anyone else or for anything other than the benefit of the minor.

And to take withdrawals from it, you either have to submit proof that the funds are being used for the benefit of minor or you can get a checkbook (this is the best way due to the fact that Merrill does not have to obtain proof) 

Personally, I would recommend you opening a normal CMA account in your name and letting her deposit funds in it and teach her about brokerage accounts until she is 18. After she turns 18, she can open an account in her name and you can easily have everything in the account transferred to her new account. 

Or, of course, she can wait until she is 18 and open an account then. 


I will also note to NEVER tell Merrill or a Financial Service Representative that your daughter is accessing the account in any way while it is in your name. That is considered friendly fraud and merrill will lock your user id and make you change it to a new ID and have you say that you understand to not share the login with anyone. 

That was a lot of information! And of course, the decision is yours in the end! I",0,Haitani86,4,1717345680,2024-06-02 16:28:00,02 June 2024

"Wise Bank account Changed, TDAmeritrade doesn't support new account",17cvthq,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/17cvthq/wise_bank_account_changed_tdameritrade_doesnt/,"I'm a Japanese Expat and have been using Wise (formerly TransferWise) to send money back and forth between my Japan bank account and TDA. It's worked flawlessly for about 2 years and has made this process extremely easy and convenient, And has even worked for large amounts (I got a nice bonus in April and was able to do wire transfers between both accounts without issue, And Currency exchange is quick, easy, and transparent).

Just a few days ago I got an Email and notification from Wise saying , my Bank Account details had changed, and to update them where I use them. TDA is the ONLY place I use the USD bank account, so that should be a simple Delete/Re-add before my next salary, No problem.

When I tried to Re-add the new bank details (Changing from ""Evolve Bank and Trust"" to ""Community Federal Savings Bank""), I got an Error saying ""TDAmeritrade doesn't work with some financial institutions"". WHAT?

Support responded saying just ""I would like to confirm that TD Ameritrade does not support all financial institutions, and I am not aware of any plans to change this policy.  You are welcome to link a more traditional US bank account for electronic transfers.""

Wise is my only USD bank account, So I'm kinda screwed (Or Extremely Inconvenienced) by this unless I can get Wise to make a Separate USD backend bank account for me that's compatible with TDA (currently trying), OR needing to ""link a more traditional US bank account"", Whatever that means??? At that point I'd need open a completely unnecessary Bank account, which I don't want to do, and transfer money between TWO intermediary banks to get it to TDA.

(Sidenote: I haven't received ANYTHING about the transition of my account to Schwab yet, Which I'm fine with, but thought I'd have gotten some kind of update about it by  this point.)

Is it wrong to be angry at TDA here? W H Y does the financial institution matter for TRANSFERS? W H Y is there restrictions between doing a simple Wire Transfer between TDA and a domestic US Bank Account? I'd usually think Wise here would be the bad guy in this situation but TDA not allowing wire transfers because the bank account isn't ""Traditional"" enough (Again, Whatever that's supposed to mean) ??? Like What? I feel like this is completely ridiculous. Is this TDA/Schwab doing this on their own or is this a US Banking Regulation? Is this that 1984 thing I've been hearing so much about in practice? This is the first time I've been CUT OFF from accessing my own money.

EDIT : I should add, I DO sometimes rely on my TDA money for lifestyle expenses and bills. My Salary here is currently about $1300 USD Equivalent / month, Which is a pitiful wage but usually enough to get by without issue. I currently have less than $100 to get to my salary in 4 days, After which I immediately pay a handful of bills and make my TDA deposit. IF I'm running on fumes here the last few days of the month, I rely on taking $100 or $200 from TDA to pay for food and necessary Transportation for work. Cutting off my ability to make these transfers could LITERALLY mean I can't afford food or pay to get to work for a handful of days at the end of the month. This isn't just an inconvenience, This can cut off my livelihood, albeit for a short period of time.",kizl2mf,tdameritrade,"I have the same problem, any suggestion how to proceed? been using WISE as im a non-US resident, impossible for me to have a SSN.

Margin Balance Discrepancy Between ToS and Schwab.,1i8i9i3,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkorswim/comments/1i8i9i3/margin_balance_discrepancy_between_tos_and_schwab/,"I have a bit more short puts than I have cash to cover. But I have plenty of other long stock positions that more than cover them so that it isn’t risky.

I want to put the cash to work in BIL while securing the puts but TOS says I have a negative margin balance even though I have a lot of cash sitting there. 

The Schwab site and app don’t show any negative margin balances and show I have zero margin balance subject to interest. This is all settled trades. 

What should I be looking at to know how much BIL I can buy before getting interest. 

At this point I’m wondering if I just go Fidelity so my cash securing puts get 4%+ through the cash sweep. I like ToS but using BIL as a synthetic cash sweep is really annoying. ",m8u53qb,thinkorswim,"If you have short puts and long stock, the long stock doesn't cover the short puts.  Short stock would cover the short puts.  By being long stock and being short puts, you are increasing your risk compared to just holding one position or the other.  Not saying this is bad, but your description of your risk is wrong.  Or maybe you mean you could sell your stock to come up with the cash to cover assignment on your puts.

In terms of cash management while shorting options, I find it helpful to think of 3 baskets - cash, long stock, and short options.  You can buy things like stocks, bonds, money markets, etc until you run out of cash.  You can continue buying things beyond that, but you will be taking a margin loan and paying interest.  At the same time you can sell options (assuming the correct account permissions).  The short options will bring cash into your account.  It's up to you to balance the overall risk in your portfolio between long stock and short options plays.  I also find it helpful to keep some cash in something like SWVXX that I can sell to cover any losses on short options (you have to spend cash to buy back a short option that doesn't expire worthless).

In terms of seeing how much cash you have available, you can look at 'cash and sweep vehicle' in TOS.  You might have to add that field.  That amount is how much cash you have left to buy things with before you start incurring margin interest.  If it's negative, you're getting charged margin interest.  This typically matches a field that Schwab shows, but if you have any margin interest charges for the month those will be deducted from the balance Schwab shows (but not the TOS balance). When you have unsettled trades, you just have to keep a mental tally of what those trades will do to your cash balance when they settle.  So for example, I tend to sweep proceeds from selling puts into SWVXX until I get enough to buy something else with it.  As I sell puts, my cash and sweep vehicle number will go up by the amount I collected for the puts.  At the end of the day, I'll put in an order to buy SWVXX for whatever I sold my puts for.  That trade will execute overnight, and both trades will settle the next day.",0,ducatista9,5,1737683206,2025-01-24 1:46:46,24 January 2025

1. I have a very small amount of foreign dividend income in from my Fidelity brokerage account this year.
2. I paid some foreign taxes on this income.
3. In order to minimize my US tax liability, I think I'm supposed to fill out form 1116 and claim these foreign taxes as a credit.
4. Fidelity gave me a form 1099-DIV that shows my roreign dividend income and foreign tax paid.
5. I think Fidelity only shows this information in US dollars.
6. In form 1116 part 2, I am supposed to put foreign tax paid in both USD and the foreign currency.
7. I could have made a mistake above, let me know.
8. If not, **how do I come up with the foreign tax paid, denominated in the foreign currency?**
9. **Can I just go search the most recent exchange rate and convert it myself?\***
10. **Is this information somewhere else from Fidelity?**

\*(but the exchange rate varies over time and between markets/data sources, and my foreign tax payments occurred on multiple days throughout last year)

Money Market Funds and Buying Power,12ng9zx,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/12ng9zx/money_market_funds_and_buying_power/,"I have quite a bit of cash in my trading account, and instead of letting that cash collect .35%, I decided to be proactive and place this cash in a money market fund that has been recommended here, SWVXX. However, I noticed that when I put money into SWVXX, my option buying power was reduced by the same amount. Thus, this cash can't be used for cash-secured puts.

Are there any alternatives to this? It's my understanding that Fidelity has SPAXX, which can still be used as collateral for cash-secured puts. If not, then it doesn't make much sense to leave this cash in TD Ameritrade when I have an HYS account at CIT Bank which pays a 4.5% yield, or can use another broker which would allow me to collect higher interest on this cash.",jgf4mwo,tdameritrade,Fidelity doesn’t treat their MMFs like mutual funds. If I sell a position in my brokerage account there it immediately goes into SPAXX (MMF) and I can buy something else if I choose. If I buy another (higher yielding) MMF it doesn’t get executed until market close so that adds a day. But once that MMF order executes I can immediately deploy those funds and buy something else. That’s why I use a short term bond ETF at TDA in lieu of a Schwab MMF.,0,dbcooper4,1,1681602302,2023-04-15 23:45:02,15 April 2023

Remove the word 'guarantee' from your vernacular. There are no guarantees in investing, only probabilities.

The 10% per year figure you're referencing is taken from *hundreds* of years of historical data - not one. It can only be applied on the assumption that you stay invested and continue to invest for a long enough time period to ride out the volatility of the markets. 1-2 years is not long term. It does not allow enough time for compounding to work effectively.

The statistical probability that you will make a net loss from consistent contributions is almost eradicated around the 5 year mark, but not an impossibility.

This is the reason why many people say 5 years should be a *barest* minimum, but to see the best results you should have a much, much longer time horizon.",0,TacticalChalky,4,1742388311,2025-03-19 12:45:11,19 March 2025

Once the card goes public your payments will be reported and it will then cause your credit score to be updated. Getting the credit card will have an inquiry on your credit report though

Last year i got carried away and made a stupid Frankenstein portfolio and the recent events have made me consider what’s really important and to stick to index funds as I just got lucky riding a bull run last year with the stocks I picked.

I’m now left with about £600 of losses on individual stocks (MSFT £100 down, LVMH down £200, Whirlpool down £55, and the rest in individual tech stock pies it’s the currency that has hurt too).

My main capital is in solid index funds like VUAG, FWRG, MUED, VUKE. I don’t plan to sell these and having learnt over the past year, I’m just going to buy and hold rather than pick individual stocks as what I had previously what I thought was safe pics all are impacted by tariffs (healthcare, railroads, consumer items, and particularly LVMH fml).

Shall I just cut my losses? It should free up about £5,000 cash to ride out any more dips or stock in the index funds and not worry about individual stocks. I’m thinking live to fight another today, but £600 feels painful….

Do You Trust Your Fidelity Advisor?,1g87gn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1g87gn6/do_you_trust_your_fidelity_advisor/,"My account is barely a week old but I have already been given bad advice by my assigned Fidelity Advisor (he pushed me into using a CMA account to do BillPay and I realized after getting my rent money locked, calling them to ask about it, and then doing additional research here, that that was a mistake), and been forced to undo the mistakes he lured me into.

This entire thing could have been avoided if he had NOT deliberately changed my mind about using a Chase account instead, or if he had WARNED me that the account had several caveats that needed special attention (the 3-week delay on deposits leading to it needing an extra-long setup time), or if there was a big notice saying ""HEY YOUR FUNDS ARE STILL BEING HELD DONT USE BILLPAY YET"" on the BillPay page, or if they could have unlocked maybe 15% of the transferred funds when I called to ask, or if they were willing to reimburse the wire transfer fee my bank charges for me to transfer in more money to cover what I was trying to do.

But apparently none of that could be done, so, um.

Now I'm reconsidering some of my previous plans and reviewing everything else he said to me with a grain of salt, and I'd like to know how much you all trust your advisors in general and what my expectations should be.

Do they often give bad advice? What other kind of bad advice should I be wary of?

Do they ever give good advice, or should I generally ignore them and do my own research?

It's just how I setup my income when I was working and used the routing number and my account number to set up auto pay to have my bills debited from my individual taxable account. I did have a Fidelity advisor help me with liquidating some positions to have money for a down payment for a house and sustain me easily for a year when I was planning on retiring as the Federal Government takes awhile for you to start receiving your pension checks (took five months) but he's gone to a different position with Fidelity so he's no longer my advisor so I have a new one but he really hasn't done anything for me as I'm not needing any help at the moment. I think I need to go to a tax strategist to see about converting my rollover IRA to my Roth. I'm not sure that a Fidelity advisor can help me with that but I'll ask him since they've been calling me to set up an appointment with him.

Years of experience by platform.

TD Ameritrade: 10+

e\*Trade: 5+

Schwab: \~3

I really don't understand why Schwab is moving TD to the Schwab platform when the TD platform is so superior but the piece that I just can't get over is why Schwab didn't take the hover pop-up and move it over when they brought over ToS. That hover popup is so useful on decision making without going off platform. I do all of my screening and analytics with google finance and finviz so I don't need a replacement for that but I do need a data rich holdings platform.

I much prefer the e\*Trade holdings grid to the schwab so I would go there except the lack of the hover pop-up and really bad click through page is close to useless.

With the TD web platform I have everything I desire with the left side with the holdings and hover pop-up and the right side dock customized with all the broader info (news, markets, watchlists). As far as I can tell, no other of the big platforms allow any customizations beyond columns and column order. No widgets, or dock like info, no hover pop-ups with relevant next level stock info.

I like e\*Trade's options screen better than TD's popup but there doesn't seem to be anything better about Schwab on any matters of importance. 

I haven't found anything I like about IBKR.  It seems style over substance.

With 40 days left, I can't believe I'm stuck with Schwab abandoning the 9/10 platform and migrating clients to the simpleton app that works best for buy and hold investing.

300k lost,1eat30v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1eat30v/300k_lost/,">OK, I am going to start ignoring replies here. I see that most of them are either blaming me for my ignorance, empathizing with me or allowing this to serve as a reminder that they also need to roll something over. None of which are helpful but at least the empathizers are being nice.  
For those of you that came in here, and spent time to write a post along the lines of ""It's your fault, what kind of dummy doesn't know the rules of a 401k""; go touch some grass. I asked for help getting my money back or insight from the community about what I could do and all you can do is point and laugh? Worthless.  
Thanks to those that offered advice. I am going to continue to pressure Inspira to find my money. That seems like the only thing I can do at this point.

I am going to try and keep this vague to prevent corporate retaliation but here's my tale:

I was notified via LifeLock on 2025-06-16 that hundreds of thousands of dollars were being transferred out of my 401k account with Fidelity. This was not something I had asked for so I immediately thought ""Fraud"". Since it was a weekend I could only reach a basic CSR at Fidelity who told me it was ""Account Maintenance"" and I should wait until Monday and it should be back where it came from. Come Monday the money is still missing.

Got on the horn with a Fidelity 401k specialist who informed me that my former employer (10+ ago) had ended their relationship with Fidelity and my 300k had been transferred to Inspira, a company I have never heard of. The conversation went something like this:

ME: You sent my money somewhere without letting me know it was going to happen?

CSR: Your employer should have let you know.

ME: I have not spoken to, or contacted anyone from that company in around 10 years. Why would they be responsible for contacting me? You are the ones holding my money, you have my email, phone number & current address. You ask me to verify it every 3rd time I log on to your site! Can you get my money back please?

CSR: No, it's already been sent. You will need to contact Inspira.

ME: So you guys sent my money to someone I have never heard of, accept no responsibility for the situation I am in now, and you want me to go and track it down and beg them to give it back?

CSR: yeah, sorry.

Got on Inspira's website, tried to use the automated tools to find my account, nope: ""Operation failed. Please contact client service"". After multiple calls I finally got ahold of someone, tells me to try again in a few weeks as the transfer from Fidelity can take that long. Wait a few weeks, call back, CSR now tells me that I need to fill out a form (PDF) and send it back to them with a picture of my driver's license. The form wants my SSN, mother's maiden, wife's name and SSN, I immediately knew this was going to be trouble, all of that should have come from Fidelity.

ok, fine. Filled the forms out except for the signature (**since I do not agree to the TOS**) and sent them back with all of my personal data attached on July 15th. Haven't heard anything back, just all of my data out there in someone's email box.

At this point it's been more than a month and I have lost, according to the last ROI in Fidelity, a month of 30% return. Inspira cannot locate my money, Fidelity doesn't care, and I am losing hope. I am not a big shot investor, this was my retirement fund. I trusted that Fidelity was looking out for me and they failed me big time.

The questions I have for the wiser Redditors is this: What can I do now? Is there a legal option for getting my money back? What kind of lawyer do I look for? I have an Employee stock purchase program and another 401k with Fidelity, should I escape before this can happen again?",levro6k,Fidelity,"Lawyer? Why? Just to waste OP's money?

65€ commission for 1 trade??,1bv2grn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibkr/comments/1bv2grn/65_commission_for_1_trade/,"Hi community,

I'm new to IBKR and wanted to place my first order and it says I'll be charged between 3.25 and 65€ commission. I have selected the tiered pricing and am based in Spain.

I'm currently using Trade Republic where they simply charge 1€. How can there be such a difference?

Can someone please help?

",ky5n00h,ibkr,"Because IBKR is obviously not the cheapest broker in terms of commissions. 
In your case, IBKR takes 3,25€, the rest is taken by the exchange. 65€ is just the commission of the most expensive exchange among all the exchanges on which LCUW is traded. In theory IBKR's algorithm for choosing an best price exchange should take into account the commission, therefore IBKR will never send your order to such an expensive exchange. And in general 65€ as max. commission is very rare.",0,qdbd,1,1712317100,2024-04-05 11:38:20,05 April 2024

Self Directed RESP! (Early Access),1jw5jao,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jw5jao,After a long long wait and exciting news for many here.,mmfvac6,Wealthsimple,"More details from the email:

We’re actively working to add more functionality as quickly as possible. As this is a beta, some features planned for the final product aren’t available just yet.

Here’s what you should know about self-directed RESPs during early access:

- Accounts will only be available on our web trading platform at first. You can open this new account by selecting “Add an account” > “Investing” > “Self-directed RESP account”.

- Clients in British Columbia and Quebec can open self-directed RESPs, but provincial education savings grants (BCTESG and QESI) aren’t supported just yet. You're welcome to open an account now, but you'll miss out on these grants, and we can't apply them retroactively. If these grants are important to you, we recommend waiting until we've integrated them (we're working on it).

- We're currently offering family plan RESPs only. This means each RESP can have multiple beneficiaries (children who'll benefit from the savings), but only one account owner (typically a parent or guardian). Individual plans and joint ownership aren't available in the beta yet, but we're working on expanding our offerings.

- Want to transfer an existing RESP from another institution? We've got you covered, but you'll need to reach out to our client support team here. They'll guide you through the process and ensure a smooth transition.",0,kdugl,3,1744313168,2025-04-10 19:26:08,10 April 2025

* Sell N shares, make a note of Y = the money receive.
* Compute Y - N\*X = that's my capital gain.

Resurrect the Magic Mouse ✨🐭,1eqphib,https://www.reddit.com/r/Etoro/comments/1eqphib/resurrect_the_magic_mouse/,"You know who I’m talking about, right?

Everyone’s favourite mouse has lost his sparkle since the start of April. Disney are down about 30% since then but I think this is a great opportunity to buy in.

Bob Iger, Disney’s CEO, has been on a crusade to scale streaming & make it profitable to drive growth.

And it looks like it’s working. 👀

Disney’s Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) segment showed 15% revenue growth this quarter.

Let’s take a look at where that’s coming from 👇

- **Subscription Boosts**: Disney+ cracked down on password sharing which is good & bad for me. It boosts the stock I own but no more free Disney movies. This, coupled with new streaming bundles & expanding internationally, increased subscriber numbers by 11.9% year-on-year. 📺🌍

- **Advertising Surge**: Domestic streaming advertisers jumped over 20%, thanks to automation & programmatic advertising. I call that the Meta Model. More ads = more revenue! 💰

- **Price Hikes**: Starting mid-October, Disney+ and Hulu prices are going up by $1-$2 per month. Hulu will see a hefty $6 increase! There’ll be some attrition but overall this will definitely boost revenue. 📈💵

Domestic parks are usually a solid constant on the Disney balance sheet but they’ve not been so magical lately. The blames being put on high interest rates cutting back consumer spending. 🏰 Theory says Disney parks will bounce back once interest rates drop & families flood back to the happiest place on earth & I think that’s a reasonable expectation.

If they can get both cylinders firing at the same time, then we’ll see the overall growth & stock price come back in a big way, in my opinion. They’ve got it down on the DTC streaming, just need the parks & cruises to get it together.

Looking ahead for the rest of the year, Disney are looking to tap into mid-teens for more DTC growth from the new streaming bundles I mentioned & continuing the international expansion.

ESPN has had a steady 5% growth rate domestically & internationally & they’re expecting that to continue. Parks & cruises aren’t pencilled in for much other than 1% growth but no shocks there.

Fair value with conservative growth estimates should bring us out somewhere around $110. Technical analysis with previous resistance level’s could be closer to $120 if we get the growth & momentum. From current price, that’ll give us a 30-35% upside.

All that said, I think Disney does come with a fair amount of risk. They have $47billion in debt which is pretty hefty & if they aren’t able to maintain growth in the streaming space or the parks don’t make a comeback then I think it’ll flatline the upside potential.

Keep in mind that Robinhood's relationship with Citadel was always an informal customer relationship, not a formal business partnership. 

The reason why I always talk up Robinhood is because they get so much unfair hate online. They're the cheapest/best broker, but got a ton of blame for stuff out of their hands.

Singapore’s high cost of living, especially housing, has me wondering if retirement abroad is a viable strategy.
Some friends’ parents moved to JB to stretch their retirement dollars, but eventually came back due to healthcare concerns. Others say you can “live like a king” in places like Thailand or Indonesia.
If you’ve seriously planned for this or already made the move:


How much do you really need to retire abroad?


What’s your backup plan if things don’t work out?


Would you do it again, knowing what you know now?

2 of them did eventually come back to sg because of old age and healthcare plus easier for kids and grand kids to take care of them. But prior to that was retired in JB for like 10+ years or more.

IBKR for UAE prop trading firms,1jfl03a,https://www.reddit.com/r/interactivebrokers/comments/1jfl03a/ibkr_for_uae_prop_trading_firms/,"Hey everyone,

I’m planning to set up a company in the UAE specifically for trading US stocks and options through Interactive Brokers (IBKR). It would operate as a self-funded proprietary trading firm — only my own capital, no client funds.

I’m trying to figure out the best free zone or mainland structure that allows this activity, supports opening a corporate IBKR account, and keeps compliance and audit requirements manageable. Visa eligibility is also important since I’d like to move my residency under the company once done.

One of the main reasons I’m leaning towards a proper company setup is because trading income through a personal account isn’t considered salary by banks — making it harder when it comes to underwriting loans or credit facilities.

If anyone here has gone through this or has experience setting up something similar:
	•	Which free zone or structure did you choose?
	•	Any specific licenses required?
	•	How’s the experience been with audits/compliance?
	•	Any challenges or things you’d do differently?

Would really appreciate any insights or recommendations!",mixvy58,InteractiveBrokers,"This has been super insightful, really appreciate your effort on trying to explain this whole thing.

So far from what I’ve heard is it’s the same sort of hesitation from banks, quite surprising that they don’t seem to understand us, not like we are risking any of their float. 

I think someone has to come up with full stack solution for traders, last year or so I’ve worked on full integration with accounting software like zoho books etc, just figuring out this part & really not going anywhere. 

My issue with BVI or Estonia is that they have significant compliance checks now, they don’t let you open the IBKR account unless you have some ties or massive compliance teams. Moreover this part of banks seeing our P&L is important for me to get into some real estate in parallel.  

Maybe the next billion dollar startup idea indeed is to come with a full prop trader stack…",0,ashrithgovind,1,1742545055,2025-03-21 8:17:35,21 March 2025

What is the cleanest way to do a non-deductible traditional IRA contribution --> Roth conversion?,1fb7mec,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1fb7mec/what_is_the_cleanest_way_to_do_a_nondeductible/,"I have a rollover IRA and a Roth IRA at Fidelity. I am ineligible to make either a deductible traditional IRA or standard Roth contribution.

I understand that I can make a non-deductible contribution and do a Roth conversion. The actual ""conversion"" seems as simple as using the ""Move Money"" page on the website.

I see that I can make a contribution to my rollover IRA from my bank account. How do we (me and the IRS) ""know"" it is non-deductible? Is it just that I don't deduct it on my 1040?

Also I read an article that advised to wait a month between making the non-deductible traditional IRA contribution and converting it to a Roth, so that there is an account trail that shows the flow. I mean I guess, but isn't that all tracked already?

Anyway, what about gain/loss in whatever length of time it is in the traditional IRA before converting? Does that need to be accounted for? And if so, is it cleaner to open an additional traditional IRA account just for this type of rollover? I can imagine I would be doing this conversion yearly going forward.

No waiting is required.

And if so, is it cleaner to open an additional traditional IRA account just for this type of rollover? I can imagine I would be doing this conversion yearly going forward.

You would ideally convert cash. If you convert more than your contribution, the amount in excess of the contribution is taxable as income. Most people get this in the form of residual interest waiting for the deposit to the traditional IRA to settle. Opening a separate account is irrelevant to the process as the IRS views all owned pretax IRAs as one single account. 

If you have existing traditional IRA balances, you need to read up on the pro rata rule.",0,nkyguy1988,2,1725751776,2024-09-07 23:29:36,07 September 2024
Explain to me how this makes any fucking sense then I’m somehow down $75 despite the fact it went up 20% from when I bought it,1eo57s0,https://v.redd.it/wizmctfq7ohd1,[No text content],lhgkmx1,Etoro,"I think you may wish to use the virtual portfolio first and do some research on the different terms in eToro. 

Firstly, the “change” column is what I believe to be the change % of the price for the day. Nothing to do with your portfolio. This is simply open value vs current price or close price if past market close. 

Secondly, you placed a market order which means you’ll buy at the current price in the market. You also need to be aware of market speed which is the difference between selling and buying prices which differ to the market price of the shares. Think of a buyer seller type of deal when buying a car, neither price is the value of the car.

Thirdly, research limit orders and stop loss. 

Limit order when buying: the purchase will only trigger when the price drops to the desired price (don’t use it to buy at a higher price please).

Stop loss: use it to stop losses. Really this is up to you and your risk appetite but my own strategy is a long view trader and never buy to short the stock. So I buy a stock I think is going to go up and I leave it. It may go down or up. I just ignore it. When the stock gets to a position I am happy with an want to protect, I put a stop loss in place but I leave a decent gap to allow for temporary market volatility but if there is a permanent drop due to a bear market (basically what we all experienced over the last two weeks), then it will trigger a sale and protect my profits and then it allows me to monitor and enter at a point I believe is the lower point before a bull market starts again. 

Do your research and come up with a strategy. Don’t try and play both sides is my advice but it is up to you.",0,unknown,1,1723308815,2024-08-10 16:53:35,10 August 2024
"GIA UK - buying and selling US stocks, Tax implications?",mql10m,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreetradeApp/comments/mql10m/gia_uk_buying_and_selling_us_stocks_tax/,"Hi,

I am UK based and have a GIA with Freetrade. I've begun buying some small stocks from the UK but I want to diversify with US Stocks. Although despite how much I read about Tax when buying and selling US stocks, I don't feel confident in my understanding. 

Can anyone please share some information on how to do this? 

From my understanding:

1) Buying US stocks there is an FX charge.
 Once you've bought a US stock you own it.
2) if the value goes up from this Stock and I decide to sell it, I have to check to make sure I haven't gone over my Capital Gains allowance (CGA) for the year with the gains (there's also a US stock sell fee when I sell of 15% - Freetrade automatically deduct this charge).
3) if I haven't gone over Capital Gains allowance, I get to keep the profit made.
4) if I've made a profit that went over the CGA then I'm liable to submit a tax return to HMRC? 

Is this above correct, or have I missed any charges to the US? 

Dividends I believe there's a £2000 allowance for the year? If above I have to submit a tax return or is this different with foreign dividends?

Many thanks in advance.",gugnc39,FreetradeApp,You have to consider CGT with UK stocks as well there isn’t an exemption there either. For US stocks there is a FX charge / conversion rate as well.

Generate passive income on large balance of ETFs and Cash in IBKR with moderate risk,1bb6wi2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibkr/comments/1bb6wi2/generate_passive_income_on_large_balance_of_etfs/,"Other than CC and CSPs, are there good ways to play for 12-15% yields p.a.

",ku7hsa1,ibkr,"Like annual yields? 

If annual try junk bonds and other corporate fixed income. Companies being restructured after being acquired as well offer very high interest for their debt. Is it 500k in cash or cash equivalents? Just buy US debt obligations with the remaining cash to hedge against market risk. Bond market value normally increase when the stock market goes up as investors flock to riskier assets. 

Derivatives. Interest rate swaps also deliver good income and are a hedge. I love derivatives. But for now, just interest rate swaps or commodity futures. I’d say oil is always a good and stable investment but now it isn’t as much. Still very stable, but the sector is going through change. 

Hedging the sectors you’re investing in as well. Certain sectors are more elastic to changes in the economy than others. If I’m investing in a coffee company, I’ll want to hedge by buying covered puts, where you only pay the premium if it expires.

I have some basic questions about IBKR,1jwd3tf,https://www.reddit.com/r/interactivebrokers/comments/1jwd3tf/i_have_some_basic_questions_about_ibkr/,"Ok so I only want an account on Interactive Brokers cause there's an Australian stock I want to buy, it's a currently a penny stock, it's literally worth just Australian pennies at the moment but I think this company might be successful in the long run. 

I'm poor and I only wanna buy about 200 US dollars of this Australian stock, that's it, I just want to buy one stock and one stock only and then hold onto it for years, as I think in the long run this company might be successful. And I'm poor so I only have so much money to play with.

So I currently own one stock and one stock only already on Charles Schwab, $TSOI it's an American company and I got scammed with TSOI, the CEO of TSOI is a liar and a fraud, he lied to us and convinced us that he was conducting a phase 3 trial and well it turns out that was a complete lie, there was no phase 3 trial. I'm poor so I only bought about 500 dollars of TSOI stock and then later on I realized I got scammed.

So as you can see I'm poor. I only own one stock and that is $TSOI and now, there is an Australian stock that I want to spend about 200 US dollars on (I would spend much more but I'm poor at the moment).

Oh wait let me stop you right there and explain this, so I called Charles Schwab and spoke to someone there and they said that that all I had to do was tell them how many shares of this Australian stock I wanted to buy and then they'd put the order in but the commission fee would be 100 dollars. So I only want to buy like about 200 dollars worth of this Australian penny stock and they would charge me a 100 dollar fee for it.

So that is when I started googling and found a random Reddit thread and someone mentioned Interactive Brokers for purchasing international stocks (I live the USA of course). 

I googled ""How to buy Australian stock if you live in the USA"" and started reading Reddit threads and that's how I found IBKR.

So at this point I've made an account on Interactive Brokers and I chose IBKR Lite (can I purchase ASX stock with IBKR Lite?) and it currently says my application is being processed.

So I haven't deposited any money yet into my account, can I just deposit 200 dollars into the account and buy 200 dollars worth of this ASX penny stock? Do I have to deposit more than 200 dollars? Any hidden fees I need to worry about? What all fees do I need to worry about? I'm poor so I need to know.

Earlier today I called Interactive Brokers and spoke to a guy on the phone who said, I'd have to bare minimum deposit like 400 dollars into my account and then I could buy this ASX penny stock and the commission fee would only be 6 dollars and I said to him ""That almost sounds too good to be true."" Cause Charles Schwab wanted to charge me a 100 dollar commission fee just from them, and an additional commission fee from the local brokerage firm in Australia whom they work with, I can't remember the exact words the guy said. So a 6 dollar commission fee almost sounds too good to be true so what's the catch?

So what is the bare minimum amount I have to deposit? Can I purchase ASX stock with an IBKR Lite account? Yeah the agent I talked to didn't say anything about IBKR Lite or IBKR Pro and which I should choose? So I chose IBKR Lite and I'm only looking to buy one stock and just hold onto it for years. There are no inactivity fees right? I just wanna buy one stock and hold onto it for years.

I would tell you the ticker symbol of this stock but I don't wanna pump it much before I have a chance to go buy it. After I buy it then I'll come back here and make another post and tell you all about it. 

You know if I tell you it some of you might go buy it and that would raise the price of it and I don't wanna do that before I buy it myself.

Thanks.",mmj0r45,InteractiveBrokers,"I just wanted to add, the margin requirements might be \~150% of the actual price of the Stock.

Meaning to keep the position open, you might need MORE than the initial purchase price, or they will just auto-liquidate your position.

I am unsure if this applies to a Cash account.  But a penny Stock on the ASX is likely considered very high-risk by IBKR and they might want that cushion of safety

TD Ameritrade is beginning to charge users USD$50/month maintenance fees,16srut5,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/16srut5/td_ameritrade_is_beginning_to_charge_users/,"I've been one of TD Ameritrade's defenders after its acquisition by Charles Schwab. Over the better part of 3 years, I've been assured by TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab that the user experience is not going to change.

On the morning of 26 September 2023, TD Ameritrade customers in Singapore received an email stating that TD Ameritrade now intends to focus on Accredited Investors only, which are defined as individuals with:

* Personal income in excess of S$300,000 per year (or its equivalent in foreign currency)
* Net personal assets in excess of S$2,000,000 including residence (or its equivalent in foreign currency)
* Net personal financial assets in excess of S$1,000,000 (or its equivalent in foreign currency)

This expectedly excludes the large majority of retail investors.

**Beginning 27 October 2023,** **all remaining non-Accredited Investor accounts** will be charged a monthly account maintenance fee of USD$50. Accounts with balances less than USD$50 will only be charged an amount to reduce their cash balance to $0 (zero).

**As of U.S. market close on 1 December 2023**, non-Accredited Investor accounts will be restricted. We will no longer accept new trade orders to establish positions or deposits on any remaining accounts. However, you may still place liquidating orders to close positions.

**Starting at U.S. market open on 4 December 2023**, any remaining accounts (excluding those of Accredited Investors) with a debit balance (margin loan financed by securities lending) may have positions liquidated to bring these accounts to a zero or positive cash balance. We will no longer offer securities financing. 

Now Singapore is a small country that would be perfect as a sandbox to gauge the impact of a pivot in customer segments on TD Ameritrade's business. If it turns out well, I speculate that the pivot could be scaled to other markets as well.

Time to move to IBKR I guess.

Does Merrill Edge have similar funds to Fidelity's SPAXX or SPRXX? Can you buy Treasury bills on ME for 1 month exp and at 5.4%?,1emzypw,https://www.reddit.com/r/MerrillEdge/comments/1emzypw/does_merrill_edge_have_similar_funds_to_fidelitys/,"Hi everyone, 

I am new to the Merrill Edge community and have a few questions for loyal/knowledgeable clients of the brokerage. 

I currently use Fidelity and buy 1 month exp T-bills at 5.358% and the money that is left over (1K min for T-bills), I put in SPRXX for 5.07%. 

My reason for wanting to make the switch is because I have the BOA Customized Cash Card and want to optimize my returns and get the 4.5% or 5.25% on the online shopping category depending on how much I decide to transfer over. 

So this leads me to my question. Does Merrill Edge have similar funds to Fidelity's SPAXX or SPRXX that are fee free and yield 5%+ monthly payout? Also, could I invest the majority of my CMA balance into T-bills? For example, if I have $50,368, I would invest 50k into a T-bill and $368 into a FEE FREE fund. If these answers are both yes, would I just create a CMA account on ME's website and then link to my BOA account to get the Platinum Status?

Please let me know if this is a good idea. Is Merrill Edge worth it? Any downsides to doing this? My logic was since I already have all of this money getting 5% in funds and T-bills with this brokerage, I mind as well get all that and a credit card benefit with another. It should be the same thing/process. Right?",lh5m7fh,merrilledge,">Does Merrill Edge have similar funds to Fidelity's SPAXX or SPRXX that are fee free and yield 5%+ monthly payout?

Yes. See their rate sheet, which is updated frequently. Page 2 lists many money market mutual funds that can be purchased. [https://olui2.fs.ml.com/Publish/Content/application/pdf/GWMOL/ICCRateSheet.pdf](https://olui2.fs.ml.com/Publish/Content/application/pdf/GWMOL/ICCRateSheet.pdf)

>could I invest the majority of my CMA balance into T-bills?

Sure.

>$368 into a FEE FREE fund.

The listed funds have no transaction fees to buy/sell, but virtually all mutual funds, including money markets, have fees expressed as expense ratios, with the quoted 7-day yield being after expenses.

>manually reinvest the money earned on the interest the month prior. Is this correct?

If you have purchased a money market fund, its dividends will be automatically reinvested into the fund. At least for TTTXX and I assume the others. As was mentioned, money in a money market fund must be liquidated to cash before it can be used elsewhere. Uninvested cash earns a low interest rate.

>TMCXX, POIXX, LEFXX, FISXX, and TTTXX. Which one is optimal?

They each have trade-offs. Some have state tax exemption. Some have higher yield but are subject to state tax. Some have equivalent yield, but different settlement times, which you can see once you have an account. Some have floating NAV, so some fluctuation in value. TTTXX is known to be good overall and is state tax exempt. In a no-tax state, you might find a better option.",0,bene01,2,1723144444,2024-08-08 19:14:04,08 August 2024

Leave a $100 balance on your credit card, never zero. The banks make their money that way and if you pay them interest they give you a higher credit score.

Ibkr pro vs robinhood,1hi21m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibkr/comments/1hi21m8/ibkr_pro_vs_robinhood/,"After a year of active options trading , I am debating if I should move to Robinhood. ibkr has been great overall , one of the lowest margin rates. However Robinhood is disrupting the market. I netted 7k in just trading fees which would could have been easily saved in Robinhood with its free fees. Robinhood is also getting at least 0.5% lower margin rates than Ibkr. I do keep around 300k of active margin loan which is another 1.5k of difference compared to Robinhood 

I don't use API feature of Pro. I am wondering why if at all I should stick with Ibkr. What will I miss? 

",m3273r1,ibkr,"you can't just judge by trading fees, because the execution price would be different from platform to platform. Robinhood is PFOF(Payment for order flow). You should test it yourself to see which platform gives you the net overall better prices. a lot of times PFOF gets worse execution, but you must test for yourself.

For margin, for 300k margin here is the comparison I see:  
Robinhood  
5.75% for 50k + 5.55% for 50k + 5.25% for 200k = $16,125  
IBKR  
5.83% for 100k + 5.33% for 200k = $16,490  
so in terms of margin robinhood is $365 better. but to be fair robinhood gold costs $50 per year, so the savings is actually $315 better for robinhood.

IBKR has a lot of great features/order types/access to global markets etc. that robinhood doesn't have. As well as it is a safer broker.",1,topannapot,4,1734738755,2024-12-20 23:52:35,20 December 2024

43F new to this. Just a question about transaction fees. If I am contributing to my Roth IRA monthly, does a transaction fee happen every month then since I'll be purchasing more shares of funds that I'm holding? 

Also, I'm planning a buy and hold strategy, but hypothetically if I was just selling and buying within the Roth would there be a transaction fee each time? 

I know not all investments have a transaction fee, but it's just a general question as I look at different index funds.

Thanks! ",liatws4,Fidelity,Ideally there are no fees when you’re transacting in your accounts.  You can avoid this by sticking with Fidelity funds and others labeled as no transaction fee.

Is there anything to know before signing up? If funding and withdrawal an easy process? Is it troubling that a Chinese company owns this? Please let me know what your thoughts are!

For product features, webull has the surface area for retail traders, but not for robust & high value traders, they are lack behind. For example, a covered call in ibkr can be done in 1 order(long 100 shares + short call), but I try around in webull, I can't seem to find that. In addition to that, webull didn't offer portfolio margin or prime broker account to high value traders. Could be webull's target audiences are retail traders, but not the high value day traders.

Overall, I say webull is a great broker and have many great tools, and improvements on products and features still needed, especially on for those high value clients' features.",1,bbmak0,2,1740755831,2025-02-28 15:17:11,28 February 2025

Don’t trade options with their mobile app,yy7cul,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlesSchwab/comments/yy7cul/dont_trade_options_with_their_mobile_app/,"Just wanted to send this warning here as my wife and I were using the Charles Schwab mobile app to trade options until recently. 

The app will not display your proper position: it will use the closing price from the day before to calculate your options’ value, change, and daily change. This means you will have the wrong reading all day.

When the next day comes, the error will transfer to your gain/loss menu. Now your daily change will be correct (starting the second day), but it will always count your gain/loss incorporating in the initial error.

I spoke to a few brokers and tech support people at Chuck today. Some said this was “a known issue” dating back “about a month”. The brokerage supervisor I spoke to, however, denied any knowledge of it until today. “There have been only a few reports about this, and we don’t have enough knowledge yet.”

So, in short, please do not use the Charles Schwab app to trade stock options. You will be shown the wrong data and need to do tons of calculations to get the right information.

Yes I know this is all (mostly) available in the ToS app, but actually the TD trader app has some columns that ToS doesn't have, and it's not organized the same.

I contacted Schwab and the trader I spoke to said no one had submitted such a detailed complaint/report. I suggest more people call to complain about the lack of features and doing a side-by-side comparison of the apps capabilities to share all the holes/detriment. It's going to be a shock to people who haven't seen the app and don't use the ToS app just how lacking the Schwab trader app is.

Freetrade does charge for services, Freetrade Plus, ISA, SIPP. That is their model, give the basic for free charge subscription fees for additional stuff. If that isn't working lending out shares that don't belong to them isn't in retail investors best interest.

Freetrade doesn't hold your shares they are held by a custodian, yes they are regulated by UK / US regulators respectively, however neither Freetrade nor Drivewealth (whom Freetrade ""buy"" US shares), can give me evidence my shares have been brought. They can only say if the app says it has then it has. No note of who the share was brought from, no ability to transfer the share without cashing it out. It is in an account held by a custodian which I cannot access or even view. I can only see what the app shows me with no way to verify. If they offered in specie transfers (transfers without having to sell the shares for cash and transferring the cashing), or if they allowed direct registration rather than a custodial account, then I might have more faith they own the shares I have brought.

I have heard good things, and Fidelity has been around for a while, but what has been your experience with their services as well as the UI for their app/website? Likes/dislikes?",kygp4jj,Fidelity,"The ability to do most all of your financial tasks at one place is appealing. I like that Fidelity will auto sell a money market fund if it’s needed to fund a stock purchase. At Schwab, that is not the case. The Fidelity web and app user experience is easy to understand after using it for a few weeks. Anyone will feel some frustration changing to a different platform as it’s unfamiliar. I find Fidelity to be one of the better designs. I appreciate how they integrate quickly and easily with most local banks if you want to push/pull money. Fidelity uses electronic signatures for most account setups. They have many low fee or no fee options for investing. If you’re a low-cost index investor, the fees are the same between any of the brokerages; it comes down to user experience and customer service experience. I also like how they have responded to feedback and suggestions I’ve made over the years. They called me a week after making a suggestion to fully understand what I was asking for on their platform. They were very responsive. When a relative passed away and I was tasked with handling their estate, Fidelity did a good job walking me through what needed to be done and it went smoothly.

Their education series, webinars, videos, and guides are all well done. They have monthly education that you can watch live or a replay on topics of interest. For people with a decent level of assets, you’ll have access to a local Fidelity representative. Mine is a CFP with other additional credentials. They have helped me think through some financial paths and estate planning. They would probably like it if I asked them to manage my accounts, but have never pushed it, only mentioned it. We meet a couple times a year at their local office or over video chat.

A couple suggestions. Open a brokerage account and skip the cash management account. Brokerage account will pay more on uninvested cash sitting in the account by a percentage point or two. Read about the differences (it’s been posted numerous times on Reddit). Cash Management Account helps some people by reimbursing ATM fees, where you have to have more assets in the brokerage account to get the same benefit. If starting all over, I’d skip the CMA and just do a brokerage account with Fidelity. You could some money over and use their platform for a few weeks to be sure you’re comfortable before moving it all.

"Moomoo Feedback - settings, marketing, and boundaries",1gw875r,https://www.reddit.com/r/moomoo_official/comments/1gw875r/moomoo_feedback_settings_marketing_and_boundaries/,"There are a lot of mixed reviews on Moomoo generally amongst trader, and I have just joined Moomoo yesterday, and here are some of the things I think are important:

\- Those who said Moomoo is a scam, probably had a bad experience due to some technical issues or misunderstanding of how trading work. I only look at one thing - are they regulated? The good thing is, they are heavily regulated. Even though they have a name that sounds like they have been created by a 3 year old, as long as they are properly regulated, I think everything else is fine. For most parts, the whole platform and services are quite transparent. They're just really new. They haven't got time to build up credibility yet.

\- Aggressive marketing and invasion of privacy - I don't recall at any point signing up for WhatsApp correspondence or WhatsApp follow up of any sorts. My Moomoo app notifications are on Do Not Disturb and I have opt out of all marketing and correspondence. I get WhatsApp messages in the midst of creating my new account the moment they have my phone number and email details. That IS NOT COOL. No one should be approached this way. So I blocked Moomoo on WhatsApp. Then I get the next part - the phone call. a number that doesn't connect if you missed the call and try to call back. they called multiple times and I finally picked up (Moomoo Sydney) and I told them I am busy - the staff was like ""it will only take a few seconds. Can you look at your WhatsApp?"". Repeatedly I have told them I am busy - I am in the middle of a god damn tooth surgery getting anaesthetised, getting prepped, and I told them I am in the middle of a medical procedure and they were like ""it will only take a few minutes, if you could just look at your WhatsApp"". Like what in the holy world?! I finally screamed ""I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF SURGERY"" before they said ""Ok, I will try later"" and finally let go. Does your staff have no boundaries? Do you guys have no boundaries? You guys were an excellent platform and brokerage, why ruin yourself over stupid things like these? Also, DO NOT REACH OUT TO PEOPLE ON WHATSAPP UNSOLICITED. That's just the lowest form of marketing you could go to - and that's what third-raters do.

\- Customer service - the good side is, they have a very responsive agent based chat available at any point of time. The down side, there seems to be a misalignment between their technical, customer service, and trade department. A lot of time the customer service team tried to redirect the conversation some way or the other because they didn't get the keyword that a customer would ask, and you could just tell they're searching it up as they go. Some questions are more technical and some are more laymen. Some are more market oriented and some are more operational. I ask where I could subscribe to market data and was referred to market quote (basically the same thing, though they had to really dig on the keyword, but a fair call), and when I told them to take me off marketing calls, they still thought I was talking about margin calls, which is a bit of a red flag at this point. Their solution to the marketing call was to turn off my notifications by text and email - I did not have them on in the first place. So if the customer service chat is based in the US, and their marketing people are based in Sydney, they probably are detached and a lot of information is probably lost in translation or lost in space. So that's probably something to work on. Otherwise, the customer service is definitely some AA or AAA level team considering how prompt they respond, and mostly quite accurate. They'd probably need a floor supervisor for their customer service to be able to answer some more technical questions rather than feeling like I'm speaking to ChatGPT.

\- They are a Chinese company - yea, so? Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, I honestly don't care. Are they regulated? Yea. Do they have money protection and custodian? Yea. I am ok with that, irregardless of where the app was made. In fact, most of the better apps are made in Asian countries. How many years had Facebook tried to copy WeChat and so forth, the so called super-app which could be used to pay, communicate, publish, blog, social media, almost all in one? The whole point of software/app development is always a competitive environment between companies to get to the top, irregardless of country or ethnicity. If anyone tries to bring nationality into this conversation, then we are off on the wrong foot, in the wrong direction. It is not about data collection, it is about interference. Everyone collects data. How those data were used or disclosed is the main key. How many times have different CEO of different tech firm gets brought in front of a regulatory board or congress to answer questions regarding privacy? It is not about the lack of privacy that is the concern, it is the invasion and unsolicited disclosure that matters. I am not part of any propaganda nonsense, nor am I pro anything. I am all about the money, the green notes, and that's it. For those who despise Moomoo because it was made in Hong Kong or China if you prefer (and Hong Kong was the international trading hub of Asia before Singapore grew and took over, so Hong Kong has a long history of trade understanding which I believe they would make a pretty good trading platform given the chance), if 90% of your household goods are made in China, maybe stop trying to make this into a propaganda hypocrisy. If you don't like it, it doesn't make you money, it was not up to your standard, don't use it. Trying to call something a scam just because you don't understand it, that's kinda on you. Oh, and privacy? I don't believe there's any privacy in this world at any point of time these days. They want to look at my trades? So be it. I am not Warren Buffet. I am more like Broken Buffet, with some small amount of money trying to make it. As long as I can deposit, withdraw, and use without issue, I don't think anything else is any form of privacy. You think the brokers for players like BNF/CIS don't study and keep track of what they are doing? They key word should be INVASION. Aggressive marketing and trying to hound people on WhatsApp? Not cool. Leaking personal info or leaking the trades info? Not cool. As long as they keep it internal and protected, that's fine. If they somehow had a leak, then that is something for a class action lawsuit, to get back my $20.23 worth lol.

\- Improvements - could you guys please get some lower timeframe charts? I trade on quick rapid information and I normally trade 10-30 seconds chart, and the lowest you go is 1min. If you could do 10 seconds chart you would be super duper awesome in my books.

What is this post all about? It's a rant post. Just because I can. And because I believe everyone should have a fair fighting chance, from both sides. Companies like Moomoo deserve a chance, but I'd still take a shot at them if they are being shit. And perhaps, we can learn from each other.

Cheerios!",lyd3g1j,moomoo_official,"I think it's a good move for Moomoo to follow up with their customers since some people might find investment platforms a bit tricky to understand.

After some research and thanks to some help from a fellow redditor..

I recommend to fidelity that they start advising customers of this process. Thank you to the fellow redditor that helped me get things rolling again!

Market data costs - Australian Self Managed Super Funds,1jkxb7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/interactivebrokers/comments/1jkxb7c/market_data_costs_australian_self_managed_super/,"I have recently signed up to IBKR for my self managed super fund (for non-Australian's this is a common tax advantaged retirement trust). The funds are purely for personal retirement purposes and there is no business activity or anything else that could in any way be deemed as ""professional"".

Once the account was opened I realised that IBKR have classified the account as professional on the basis that it is a trust. The primary use of the account was to trade ASX stocks, but now to see level 2 data the expense difference between non-professional ($25/month) and professional ($150/month) means that IBKR is now the most expensive broker option in Australia. A small-ish retirement account can't afford $1800 in annual data costs just to see market depth in the ASX. For comparison this is free with Commsec!

Clearly this is stupid and the tribulations of trying to explain this to IBKR help desk has me feeling like Michael Douglass in Falling Down.

Your Super Fund has an Australian Business Number, yes?

So your Super Fund - a type of trust - is conducting a business (commercial undertaking) as per your ABN. That business is to provide retirement benefits for the Fund's members, as per the Fund's trust deed.

Your Super Fund (the trust) qualifies as a professional user. You will not persuade IBKR otherwise.",-1,6JDanish,1,1743206087,2025-03-28 23:54:47,28 March 2025

Stuck on Startup Screen,1im6diu,https://i.redd.it/3izj1mnifbie1.png,[No text content],mc54jej,thinkorswim,"Fellow traders,

I have achieved working ToS on Win 7 again. Fuck Schwab so much. A virtual OS is required unless the fucktards at Schwab release a fix or we can get some Extended Kernel support but at least now I'm bulletproof from their fuckery.

\- VMWare seems like the option for best performance. Supposedly v15 works on Win 7 but I kept running into errors with Visual C++. v14.1.8 worked without any problem. That can be found here: [https://softwareupdate.vmware.com/cds/vmw-desktop/ws/](https://softwareupdate.vmware.com/cds/vmw-desktop/ws/)

\- Next you need Win 10 LTSC which can be found here: [https://massgrave.dev/windows\_ltsc\_links](https://massgrave.dev/windows_ltsc_links)

\- After that I needed to allow my bios to allow virtualization which was called SVM in the advanced bios settings on my motherboard (VMWare prompted me to do this, you may not need to)

\- If you want multiple monitors, download VMware ""tools"" from within the virtual machine: https://packages.vmware.com/tools/releases/12.5.0/windows/x64/. Then shut down the computer, make the display changes with the virtual computer off. Finally use ""VMWareResolutionSet.exe"" to specify the size and position of the other monitors: [https://superuser.com/questions/680841/possible-to-have-multiple-virtual-monitors-for-a-vmware-guest-in-windowed-mode](https://superuser.com/questions/680841/possible-to-have-multiple-virtual-monitors-for-a-vmware-guest-in-windowed-mode)

\- Finally to bring over your workspace FROM the host to the same location on the guest (virtual machine): C:\\Users\\\[YOUR USERNAME\]\\AppData\\Local\\thinkorswim via a Shared Folder (you can create this in the VM settings)

This is counterintuitive to a hands off approach that many passive investors seek to have - the more we see our balances, the harder it is to resist the urge to tinker with our allocations.

Currently we are able to hide the amounts of our balances but this is an all or nothing approach. I'm not a fan of this because if I login in public someone could potentially see my entire net value. Another option would be to hide specic account balances.

What do you guys think?",mejpli4,Wealthsimple,"No, someone being able to see you entire net worth is awful. Money creates problems, and you want as few people to see how much money you have as humanly possible.",-1,Godkun007,2,1740417074,2025-02-24 17:11:14,24 February 2025

"1-2 years, do I hold or sell?",1jin6qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/trading212/comments/1jin6qw/12_years_do_i_hold_or_sell/,"Hello all :)

Me (19m), and my girlfriend (20f) are saving up to buy a house, we currently have around half the deposit we’d need for the sort of house we are aiming for. 

After some calculations, I estimate we will reach our deposit (plus a bit for other fees and costs) at most in 2 years time. Given this short time frame for investing, should I sell my S&P500 shares and magnificent 7 shares until the market stabilises, especially since trump has hinted at the R word? I know everyone here says don’t sell but they plan to keep their money in T212 for 10+ years.",mjgf31w,Trading212,"Smart of you to think this through - when your timeline is short (like under 2 years), **capital preservation matters more than growth**.

The general rule: if you need the money soon (e.g. for a house deposit), it’s safer to **move it out of high-volatility assets** like stocks. Even something like the S&P500 can dip 10–20% in a heartbeat - and that could seriously delay your plans.

You don’t have to sell everything overnight, but gradually shifting into **cash or low-risk savings/investments** (like a high-interest savings account, money market fund, or fixed-rate ISA) might make more sense.

You’ve done the hard part - saving. Now protect it. It’s not about “missing out” - it’s about locking in the future you’re building.",0,Decent-Pause4649,3,1742811848,2025-03-24 10:24:08,24 March 2025

I called today and was told my deposit hold time is over 20 days time. The money has been released by my bank, and Fidelity has it but I can't use it because of a TikTok about fraud. I've never had fraud on my account but now I'm out of my fun money and can't touch it ;( ",lveqbzj,Fidelity,"Yes! 😁 It is a lot faster and I find it SAFER and a better option than EFTs now.. You set up the transfer process via your online banking portal (not the app) it would be under bank to bank transfers or external transfers. Unlike an EFT.. the money is debited by my bank for the transaction IMMEDIATELY when initiated and the transfer takes my bank 1-3 days standardly but since I was told about the method, I've had my deposits (from 50-700) transfer from my bank to my CMA same day and clear for withdrawal and trade when it's received.

As for your question, holding 11 positions isn’t bad at all! Aiming for 14 or 15 sounds reasonable, especially if you’re diversifying across different sectors. 

Just make sure you’re comfortable managing that many, though. It can get tricky keeping up with each one, especially if you want to stay on top of news and trends.

So now limiting people’s mobile deposits to $1,000 and holding mobile deposits and even “pull transfers” for 3 weeks has been Fidelity’s way of “mitigating fraud”. 

But not everyone seems to be affected by these restrictions. I’m not sure how they’re deciding whose accounts get the restrictions and whose don’t.

"eToro Let My Money Get Stolen, Ignored Me, and Hid the Truth – We Need to Stand Together!",1i0fzt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Etoro/comments/1i0fzt9/etoro_let_my_money_get_stolen_ignored_me_and_hid/,"Hi everyone,

I’m writing this out of sheer frustration and disappointment. My experience with **eToro** has been an absolute nightmare, and I feel compelled to share my story. **This isn’t just about me – it’s about all of us who trust platforms like eToro to protect our money and investments.**

# My Story:

A few months ago, my eToro account was **hacked**:

* No 2FA codes were sent to my phone when the hacker reset my password or made unauthorized transactions.
* When I confronted eToro about this, they claimed that the 2FA codes were sent but **refused to confirm whether they were sent to my phone number or email.**

I reported the fraud as it was happening and begged them to stop the transactions, but they did **nothing.** They didn’t even attempt to intervene or freeze my account.

# The Aftermath:

Here’s where it gets even worse:

* It took **over a month** for eToro to assign someone to speak to me, and by then, the damage was done.
* My account manager, who should have been my advocate, has completely ghosted me.
* Their fraud department and senior management were dismissive, unhelpful, and even told me to “go away.”

Out of desperation, I traveled to their **UK head office** and managed to speak to the **Head of eToro UK**. I thought this would finally lead to answers, but instead, they dismissed me again and refused to provide the clarity I needed.

# What They’re Hiding:

During my discussions with eToro, they provided **date stamps** for the unauthorized activity but refused to provide **time stamps.** This is critical because it would reveal exactly when the fraud took place, potentially exposing security failures on their end.

Why are they withholding this information? I believe it’s because they know it will make them liable. They’re doing everything they can to protect themselves while leaving customers like me in the dark.

# My Own Investigation:

Since eToro refused to help, I’ve done my own digging. Here’s what I’ve found:

* **Millions have been stolen** from eToro accounts.
* Countless victims have been ignored, brushed aside, or silenced.
* eToro’s security is deeply flawed, and they’re hiding critical details to avoid accountability.

# Why This Matters:

If you use eToro, you need to know the truth:

* **Their security is inadequate.**
* **Their customer service will abandon you when you need them most.**
* **They prioritize covering their tracks over protecting their customers.**

But I’m not here to tell anyone to leave eToro. Instead, I believe **we need to stand together**. This is about more than one person’s story – it’s about holding them accountable and demanding better for everyone.

# Help Me Expose Them:

I’m working on a **detailed report** to expose how eToro mishandled my case, ignored other victims, and tried to cover up their failures.

Please **like and share this post** so we can raise awareness and fight for accountability. The more people who speak up, the harder it will be for eToro to ignore us.

Did the desktop UI for the holdings page change for anyone else?,1i37bmr,https://i.redd.it/nnnxs8r74hde1.jpeg,"Im wondering if anyone else has noticed a change in the UI on the account holdings page on the Merrill edge website to what I’m showing above.

Annuitant Cannot Contribute to Spousal RRSP,1jwpspa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wealthsimple/comments/1jwpspa/annuitant_cannot_contribute_to_spousal_rrsp/,"Good morning all. Wanted to make a post here in case others were considering a Spousal RRSP at WealthSimple. I consider this a pretty major flaw.

My wife and I had all of our investment accounts at TD for years. Over time, we became pretty frustrated with the general support provided by TD. It seemed every time we talked to someone they were a newer employee, or inexperienced with the particular accounts, and it all came to a head when they buggered up our RESP account after our second child was born and we wanted them added. No point going into too much detail as to the errors, but it was enough to make us switch platforms.

We moved our trade accounts, TFSAs, our RESP, RRSP, and a spousal RRSP all to WealthSimple. Of note, this process was pretty cut-and-dry without much issue, though the only issue we did experience was, again, on TD's side (not closing the accounts properly once emptied and transferred). We did make some sacrifices - at TD all of our accounts were self-directed investing. At the time of transferring, WealthSimple did not offer a self-directed RESP (still don't, even though that's been promised for years...) nor a self-directed spousal RRSP. However, it was worth the transition for us to hopefully receive better support in the long run.

After some time we were invited to try out the self-directed spousal RRSP beta, which we took advantage of as soon as it was offered. We had yet to contribute any additional funds to the spousal RRSP since moving it from TD to WealthSimple, but decided to do so after converting it to a self-directed account. Here is where the frustration started.

Off the bat, you **cannot** move your own funds from a WealthSimple account nor external bank to a spousal RRSP using either the web portal nor the mobile app. When you attempt to select the account to move the funds to, it's listed as an ""illegible"" account - you have to call in to WealthSimple support to contribute any amount to it over the phone. Okay... Odd, haven't seen that on any other platforms, but sure.

So we called in, said we wanted to move a couple thousand dollars in to it, and we *specifically* wanted the contribution to be made in the annuitant's name, **not** the contributor's (spouse's) name. We have never had this issue on any other platform - a spousal RRSP is set up as such where *either* the contributor (spouse) or annuitant (owner) of the account can contribute to the account for their own tax purposes. The annuitant is the only person who can **withdraw** the funds once contributed, but either can contribute.

**This is not how WealthSimple spousal RRSPs works.**

After confirming with phone support I wanted the contribution to be made in the annuitant's name, support confirmed the transaction, we said have a nice day, and off we went.

Lo and behold, tax season arrives. We get our RSP contribution receipt. Wouldn't you know it, the contribution was made in the *contributor's* name, not the annuitant's. This of course messed up our taxes as now the contributor was over their contribution limit as they had also contributed to their own individual RRSP throughout the year. We sorted out the issue with our accountant, wrote it off as an error on WealthSimple's side during the phone transaction, and moved on. We were pissed, but there are larger things to worry about in life. We would just **ensure**, very strictly, that the next time we contributed over the phone and wanted it done in the annuitant's name that they would confirm multiple times that was the case before processing.

Well, I called WealthSimple this morning just to inform them of the error and reiterate that, while we don't want the transaction recovered and fixed at this time as we had already sorted it out, any future transactions needed to be really taken slowly to confirm the right contributor was selected. This is where I was informed:

**There is** ***no way*** **for an annuitant on a WealthSimple spousal RRSP to contribute to the RRSP.** That is just not how their accounts are set up, and it's impossible to do so. Only the spousal contributor can contribute. Both at TD, and previously for a time using Questrade it was a very simple process:

1. Select funds to move into the account
2. Select who the contributor was, spouse or annuitant
3. Confirm moving of funds and off you go, whoever was selected would have the amount reduced off their income for taxes

Apparently this is impossible to do at WealthSimple, which we were not informed of initially upon setting up the account, nor when processing the first initial transaction where we moved a couple of thousand in to it that we wanted contributed *by the annuitant*.

Anyway, that was cathartic. Thank you for humouring my rant. But take note, if you want to set up a Spousal RRSP at WealthSimple and want both parties to be able to contribute - **it ain't happening here**. Look elsewhere. We'll probably be moving our accounts off of WealthSimple again because we're also tired of waiting for the self-directed RESP. So far any updates on that progress are just farts in the wind.

\--------------------------------

EDIT: Clearly, as seen in the discussion below, there are fundamental misunderstandings of how Spousal RRSPs function. Perhaps WealthSimple is also confused in this regard?

To clarify:

**A spouse contributing to a spousal RRSP** ***does not*** **receive any sort of additional ""tax advantage"" due to this contribution. The contributor's contribution limit is reduced and deducted on their taxes** ***regardless*** **of which account they contributed to. Their contribution** ***-does not-*** **come off of the annuitant's contribution limit, which would effectively allow the contributor to contribute over their initial limit and reduce their income further.** ***-That is now how Spousal RRSPs work.-*** However, funny enough, that *is* how a staff member at TD once explained it to a family member of mine. We corrected them, informed the bank, and the bank confirmed the staff member was educated on the functionality of the account to not make that claim again. *Clearly part of the reasons why we left TD* *as well*.

Please, if you are curious about Spousal RRSPs, they are obviously still a fairly misunderstood concept. **There are -no- tax benefits to either contributors or annuitants of the individual RRSP or the Spousal RRSP** ***during contribution years***\*\*. The ""benefits"" only start during retirement and withdrawal periods, where the higher-earner and lower-earner would then effectively have the same amounts in their RRSPs during retirement for withdrawals after effectively utilizing the Spousal RRSP, so that the higher earner would not have a vastly larger RRSP and be required to withdraw larger amounts at a higher tax rate for sustainable living than the lower-income-earner does. This is the fundamental purpose of a Spousal RRSP:\*\* ***income equality during retirement***\*\*. It is not a ""tax benefit"" to the higher-income earner during years of employment and contribution.\*\*

\--------------------------------

EDIT 2: Thanks everybody. As it appears... everyone is sort of all partially correct. A few second opinions on PFC really smoothed it all out:  
  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1jwru98/a\_fundamental\_misunderstanding\_of\_spousal\_rrsps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1jwru98/a_fundamental_misunderstanding_of_spousal_rrsps/)  
  
My history of using Spousal RRSPs with different brokerages has always included the option of selecting which contributor would be adding funds when contributing to the Spousal RRSP, and you could always select the annuitant as an option. Apparently, WealthSimple is the first platform I've used where this isn't an option and they have to be two explicitly shown different accounts. Apparently, this is how it's always set up and previous brokerages have always just shown it to me as a single account with different accounts on the back-end managing the funds that I wasn't able to see.

Sometimes I wonder why things are made so complicated... Maybe they're all just ideas floated around and put into production that are never fully sifted through nor any sort of unification in presentation of how the accounts are handled across institutions... At least it's always fun.

Appreciate everybody's input. Have a great weekend all. And... happy? tax season.",mmkfem4,Wealthsimple,"This is absolutely incorrect and I have never experienced this issue on any other trade platform besides WealthSimple. The basis is actually pretty straightforward:

\- There are two spouses with RRSPs, one is an individual RRSP with one contributor and the same contributor is the same annuitant of the individual RRSP.  
\- The other spouse has a spousal RRSP, where they are the annuitant and both their spouse and themselves are the contributor. Effectively, this RRSP has two contributors.  
\- For math's sake, let's say each spouse is able to contribute $10,000/year to their RRSPs.  
\- Spouse 1, with the individual RRSP, contributes $5,000 to their individual RRSP. They then contribute $5,000 to the spouse's RRSP as the contributor, which is *deducted from their total contribution allotment*. Spouse 1 no longer has any funds to contribute to either RRSP.  
\- Spouse 2 contributes their full $10,000 to their spousal RRSP, noted in the contribution that the annuitant is the contributor, not the spouse. This spouse has effectively had $15,000 contributed to their RRSP, while the first spouse has had $5,000 contributed to theirs. ***Only the annuitant is able to take money from this spousal RRSP, and there has been no ""double-dipping"" in this instance***.

In this exact scenario it doesn't make sense as the amounts are equal, but in real life the first spouse would make more money than the second spouse, therefore having a higher RRSP contribution limit. Let's say spouse 1 can contribute $20,000 and spouse 2 can contribute $10,000. Spouse 1 puts $15,000 in their account, and $5,000 in the spousal account as contributor. Spouse 2 puts $10,000 in the spousal account as contributor. Effectively, while both contribution limits have been used up, each spouse now has an equal $15,000 amount in their RRSPs to pull from in retirement. It makes for equal income pulling and reduced incoming taxes in retirement where one spouse makes more than the other during their employment years.

**This is the whole purpose of a Spousal RRSP, so the two spouses have relatively equal RRSPs in retirement, in order to have equal retirement income, even though they had an income disparity while employed.** While not allowing the annuitant to contribute to the spousal RRSP doesn't *completely* nullify the whole purpose of it, as the annuitant can still contribute to their own individual RRSP if they want and eventually pull from 2 RRSPs in the future, it might as well be pointless now because what's the point of having two accounts to pull from... it's just a pain in the ass. Again, **I have never had this issue with any other institution using a Spousal RRSP. It is only WealthSimple.**",-1,mossboy500,1,1744381155,2025-04-11 14:19:15,11 April 2025

"Under 30 with no big commitments, but also not high earner - what are worthwhile ways to spend money besides savings and investments?",1jyu88x,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1jyu88x/under_30_with_no_big_commitments_but_also_not/,"Edit: Thanks to everyone who commented! Appreciate everyone who spent time to drop a message, but I’m gonna stop replying because I forgot that a lot of y’all can be unkind and I seem to invited some bad energy from people in my DMs as well. Well, that’s on me for putting my business on internet, I guess! I’m not gonna delete my post, but if you drop a comment I probably won’t spend any time on the post anymore, haha

Hi all! I’m 27F, and as the title suggests, I just got a FT job offer and will finally start earning an ok amount of money. This is after leaving my last job in 2021 to go do my masters, and after a long break from full time work am finally back to being able to prioritise my finances. I’ll be honest - I’ve been supported by my parents for the times that I wasn’t working. 

My salary will be on the lower end, at 2.5k, but I know it’s an employers market so I’m taking what I can for now - all this to say that I’m not really making much either, so it doesn’t really make sense for me to live life more “lavishly”. 

I have about $54k invested from part time and temp jobs, internships over the years and the last time I worked FT(again, I’m aware that this was only possible because my parents paid for everything I needed). This was partly also because I discovered FIRE and was super frugal the past four years. Hence, I find myself in a weird place, financially.

I live with my family and I’m single, plus I pack my lunch from home so I just need to pay for transportation, snacks and hobbies. I have very quiet social life outside of work due to various reasons (not for a lack of wanting one though), so no real expenses on that end either. 

I have no clue what I should be doing with my money other than maybe aggressively throwing it into the market. I don’t plan on buying a house unless I get married, so no urgency on saving for a down payment. There’s a couple trips and stuff I can save up for, but I only get 10 days of leave for the rest of the year post my probation period so I don’t really think I’ll be traveling much. 

Additionally, I have access to a small gym at no extra cost and work out twice a week with my parents with a fitness trainer - since I work out together with them, my parents are happy to pay for those sessions. 

The standard rule is 50/30/20, but my situation doesn’t really call for this since in reality my money is broken down like this:

Needs 8%:
Transport/groceries/snacks: $200

Savings 44%:
CPF: $500
Investment: $550

Wants 10%:
Hobbies: $150
Miscellaneous: $100

???: $1000

If this was me in 2021, I would have just aggressively saved and invested, while trying to be more frugal in every way, but I’ll be honest that I was creatively exhausted. I was also burnt out from trying to work 3 jobs just so I could hit this imaginary number in the hopes that I would have financial control over my choices. 

If you were in my position, what would you do? 
",mn260nf,singaporefi,"Haha I mean the answer is obvious right? Just save as much as possible, it’s not rocket science, so I was wondering if there were non tangible experiencing or things people felt was worth spending on. Is it such a bad question to ask what kind of priorities other people have? 

A lot of the standard advice in general is geared to get job > make money > save as much as possible > get married > buy home > retirement. But people live their lives in different ways and I was curious to hear if there were people who made money decisions (spending it, saving it) that they felt were worth it. 

I actually got a ton of cool answers here - some were to look at being more social, someone mentioned picking up an instrument. 

Also I dunno about you but financial independence to me is also about how to use my money so that I get the most out of it :)

You can create an API key here: [https://robinhood.com/account/crypto](https://robinhood.com/account/crypto)

Their documentation is here: [https://docs.robinhood.com/crypto/trading/](https://docs.robinhood.com/crypto/trading/)

Typically with most API tools, it will generate the credentials for you. However, this one requires a public key before doing anything. 

Doesn't Robinhood provide the public key? It won't let you proceed with the generation of a key unless you enter one.

Do not use Plus500 to trade commodities,s97mbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/plus500/comments/s97mbg/do_not_use_plus500_to_trade_commodities/,"Hi everyone

Just wanted to share my experience of using Plus500. If you want to use it for shares or currency trading then great. It has a fairly clean interface and the spreads are not too bad.

However, when it comes to commodities, this platform is terrible. Apart from crude oil, all other instruments in this sector do not follow the same markets they are meant to be underlying. If, like me, you use TradingView you will see that the moving averages do not match and the price movement are not the same.

For example, if you look at natural gas on Plus500, it claims to follow the Henry Hub futures market but one comparison and you can see it clearly doesn't. The location of the moving averages are not the same and even the price action is not the same. However, the market moves and respects the moving averages and candle formations you see on TradingView but does not on Plus500. I have no idea what market they use but its impossible to trade on. You will see a large jump in price on tradingview but be losing money on your plus500 positions. LITERALLY!!

From my personal experience I would say that if you want to use Plus500 then use it only for buying CFDs on currencies and stocks and nothing else. I'm also sure there are better platforms to use. I have decided to look elsewhere since I enjoy commodity trading and Plus500 is not the place for me.

Good luck to all.

&#x200B;

Link below will show you three images - one from tradingview, one from another independent platform and one from plus500. It is the hourly chart of natural gas and looking at the current candle forming, you can see that two match and one doesn't. I'm sure you can guess which one plus500 is.

[https://imgur.com/a/kCEbb8T](https://imgur.com/a/kCEbb8T)",htm1xyh,plus500,"I would like to make an update to this post for the sake of fairness.

Plus500 offer the price of the current future's market. At the time of this post in January 2022, the current futures contract is for February. The tradingview image posted is the spot price market and reflects current prices while future prices are not the same thing.

With this said, the futures market that Plus500 show is still not entirely the same as the future markets it is meant to reflect (when it comes to commodities). The moving averages are still in the wrong places and candle formation is still different. Therefore, I think the point remains that commodity trading on Plus500 is a no go.

Any suggestions on good platforms for commodity trading welcome (in particular spot price trading). Thanks",1,Lokes11,1,1642780900,2022-01-21 16:01:40,21 January 2022

Often, when I enter a trade, I think the setup is right, and I enter, but then the screen hangs for a few seconds, then the chart and T&S update all at once-and the price was nowhere near where it was the second I entered the order.

I was then referred to the phone team and told they would be able to help with the traceroute troubleshooting. 

  
Unfortunately, the phone tech was all but mocking me as I tried to show him the issues. He said my pc or internet was to blame. So I went out and bought a new laptop and upgraded my internet last night. I was not okay with the expense but I need to trade to make money. Well, get the laptop home and install the new modem. This morning rolls around and the issues persist. The new laptop is actually worse than my old one, so I am going to be asking Schwab to refund the fees for returning the laptop.

Minor issue, but I use one for trading and another for long term positions, and now they’re listed in reverse, so I’ll have to be careful and make sure I’m in the right account before I make a trade, as muscle memory will have me opening the wrong account.

Advantages to a 12 month CD?,19bfdy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/19bfdy1/advantages_to_a_12_month_cd/,Im seeing online that the APY for a 6 month CD is 5% while a 12 month is 4%. I’m new to all this but what would be the point of a longer CD for less return on interest? What are the advantages of the 12 month cd?,kisbakg,tdameritrade,"This sounds like a market inversion, the 12month should be higher. 

From Google Bard: 

Interest rates for longer-term bonds are typically higher than those for shorter-term bonds. This is due to a concept called interest rate risk.

Here's the breakdown:

    Longer-term bonds: When you lock your money into a bond for a longer period, you're taking on more risk as you're exposed to potential changes in interest rates over that extended time. To compensate for this risk, these bonds offer a higher coupon rate, which is the annual interest rate they pay.
    Shorter-term bonds: Since they carry less risk, shorter-term bonds usually offer lower coupon rates as investors are willing to accept less for the shorter exposure.

However, it's important to remember that this is a general trend and exceptions can occur. Here are some factors that can influence the relationship between bond maturity and interest rates:

    Market expectations: If the market expects future interest rates to rise, even longer-term bonds might not offer significantly higher rates than shorter-term ones.
    Creditworthiness of the issuer: Bonds issued by governments with strong credit ratings typically offer lower rates than those issued by riskier borrowers, regardless of maturity.
    Liquidity: Shorter-term bonds are generally more liquid, meaning they're easier to buy and sell, which can slightly lower their average interest rates compared to less liquid longer-term bonds.",0,hgreenblatt,0,1705781897,2024-01-20 20:18:17,20 January 2024

Schwab vs TD no good. NEED ALTERNATIVES,1e7wfai,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/1e7wfai/schwab_vs_td_no_good_need_alternatives/,"Quite a few people agree Schwab is not nearly as good as TD was. BIG QUESTION Where to move to next?

A couple of specific points. First i have used Think or Swim but thought it was overkill. Was very happy with TD reg app. I couple of points in comparison.

1 Charts. schwab default is chart for 1 day, No ability to add Bollinger band or moving avg. Can't even change the chart to display 6 months as a default.

2. Earnings TD showed past earnings on a bar chart with past high and low earning estimates shown. that's more info than Schwab has in less space.

3 Options expire on Friday. Schwab does not show what happened until Monday. So I have to manually log my options to see what cash I have to plan. 

4. TD showed prices before market opened. Great for planning what to do before the open.

5 TD displayed high low and avg analyst estimates. Very useful. Schwabs letter grades don't seem very good. I.E. NVIDA was a C before the recent meltdown. 

I could go on but I didn't take screen shots before I lost TD.      Besides Shwab should have done comparison before transferring accounts. 

WHATS BETTER THAN SCHWAB. Hard to transfer to Etrade or Fidelity or anyplace just to test screens. ",le7qcvv,tdameritrade,"I have Fidelity, TDA>Schwab and IBKR accounts.

IBKR is nothing like TDA or Fidelity, first you pay for data subscriptions monthly.  Second their customer service is terrible.   Third you either pay commissions on stock trades (IBKR Pro) or you get second-class treatment when it comes to interest on cash/margin rates (IBKR Lite)

IBKR is for sophisticated investors who rarely need help and don't mind paying extra for the services/products that they offer.   The average retail investor (in the US) should steer clear.

As for why I have an account - their commissions on futures trading is much better than TDA/Schwab, Fidelity doesn't even offer futures.",-1,TheOtherPete,3,1721562774,2024-07-21 11:52:54,21 July 2024

WARNING: FIDELITY WILL HOLD YOUR FUNDS HOSTAGE FOR WEEKS ON END,1g1rjrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1g1rjrq/warning_fidelity_will_hold_your_funds_hostage_for/,"EDIT: There is a megathread on a Fidelity-moderated subreddit [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/comments/1fj85a8/megathread_addressing_your_questions_about/). They seem to be actively censoring posts about this (many responses in that thread speak of posts outside that megathread being deleted to reduce visibility of this problem), which is such slimy behavior that somehow the amount that I trust them is even lower than it was when they unacceptably held my money from me.

I saw the Fidelity CMA account and decided to try it out, since the ability to earn interest on my checking funds (which are larger for me than most people) and have automatic sweeps into ETF or similar investments sounded very nice to me. So, I opened an account and instructed Fidelity via the online interface to move $15,000 from my main checking account into Fidelity via ACH. I expected this to take a day or two to settle, as ACH transactions do. Eager to begin using my new account, I logged onto the website and saw ""The remaining $15,000.00 of your recent deposit will be available to withdraw on November 2, 2024"" under my balance, showing $0.00 available to withdraw. The $15,000 have already exited my existing checking account, so this money is now unavailable to me. 

This being obviously unacceptable, I called Fidelity's support (which was a chore in and of itself — my existing bank lets me send written messages at any time via the app or website, and then they respond during business hours which is quite convenient for everyone, but Fidelity makes me call and there's no way to leave a written message), who confirmed to me that they would not release my money to me until November 2nd to withdraw from the account. Multi-week settling time for ACH transactions on a product that is designed to be used like a checking account being unacceptable, I asked him to send the money back to my original checking account and close the account with Fidelity. he also refused to do this until November 2nd. He also told me that this is a new policy that they are applying across the entire company, so it can't be some fraud signal on my account in particular.

As such, I would like to warn all other possible customers to STAY AWAY from this company. They will take your money and refuse to return it. I will also be filing a complaint with the consumer financial protection bureau. If, for some reason that is beyond me, they actually need such an extended settling period, this needs to be made very clear (not fine print ""clear"") BEFORE opening an account and again BEFORE initiating a transfer. I would be completely fucked if I had not left a good chunk of money in my checking account before making this transfer. 

Even if this problem is reversed, I think that any trust that I otherwise had for Fidelity has been irrevocably broken. You simply do not hold people's money hostage like this. If anyone has recommendations for similar products to CMA that are available at other, more trustworthy, financial institutions please share with me.",mcw80vw,Fidelity,"I deposited money through a pull transaction on the 10th. Fidelity says the money will clear on the 25th. 15 days is way to long. Also, a lot of banks have limits on external transfers - like 5,000 a day or 30,000 a month. So moving $70,000 with push transactions can take OVER 2 months.

I talked to a Fidelity Investment Adviser before making the transfer and he said nothing about the extended time to clear. I also was not given notice when setting up the transaction online.

Very frustrating.",-1,Lakesidex,1,1739624522,2025-02-15 13:02:02,15 February 2025

Sanity check my IRA portfolio?,1b2fmeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1b2fmeb/sanity_check_my_ira_portfolio/,"I was previously using a target date index fund, FDEWX, for 90% of my IRA, but I decided I wanted a lower expense ratio, and don't really need bonds yet, as I'm in my 20s. What I'm thinking I want to do now is:

45% FXAIX(S&P 500)

45% FTIHX(Foreign)

10% FISVX(Small Cap Value)



Is there anything I'm missing with this that would be in a target date fund?",ksnse5p,Fidelity,"I looked at the yearly returns of the major international stock ETF’s recently.  All of them significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  Further, the two were highly correlated.  When US stocks did poorly, so did international stocks. When US stocks had a good year, international had a better year as well.  I would ditch foreign stocks and go 100 percent into the S&P 500.  Historically, small cap value has performed well.  Yet, the last 10 years’ small cap value and small caps in general have far underperformed the S&P 500.  This is why total market index funds like the Vanguard total Stock market, the S&P 1500, and the Russel 3000 have underperformed the S&P 500.  Keep things simple and just invest in the S&P 500, get great returns and retire much earlier than those putting mixtures of low performing funds together.",-1,StatusHumble857,0,1709187774,2024-02-29 6:22:54,29 February 2024
Performance after adding 4k monitor,1j14l9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkorswim/comments/1j14l9j/performance_after_adding_4k_monitor/,"Hey Folks - I'm looking to see if anyone has encountered a similar problem / fix.

I've been trading daily with TOS for about 4 years.  I've had two 27"" 1440p monitors for the majority of that time.  New computer for last two years.  Running a single instance of TOS, primary monitor for entry, side monitor a detached grid of 15 charts.

A year ago I added a 4k monitor as a third/side monitor. I went for a second detached grid of charts on it, and the entire TOS program lagged.  It was like the quote speed went to 5 seconds (it wasn't) or like I was using OnDemand.  I gave up on using the 4k monitor for TOS, left it active as a side screen for websites/discord, TOS returned to normal.

Three weeks ago, I gave it another try. This time, moved the 4k to middle of desk and made it the primary screen for Windows and TOS entry.  Kept the 15-chart side monitor as-is, and moved the prior primary to side duty and kept TOS off it.  I essentially just replaced the main monitor from the 1440p to the 4k.  Other than realizing the L2 is terribly hard to read for my eyes, the system lag came back, again feeling like I was trading in OnDemand or with a delay.  I would have slow fills, even the entry sound/chime would stutter a tad.  I would get incorrect data between the two screens.  For example, a 2m chart on main screen would show $10.05 and the 2m chart side screen would be $9.98 and a bar or two behind before it catches up suddenly.

What I've tried so far:

* reset workspace
* reinstall TOS

I've contacted support via chat enough times that they pushed me off to the phone support.  Phone support believes its a graphics issue, as the diag report says something to the effect of my GPU (3060ti) usage will randomly go from 2% to 80%.  When running windows perf monitor, nothing goes above 10%.  He asked I generate multiple reports and call him back.  I will be calling back early next week, but figured I'd ask here.  One TOS support agent said there was an update three weeks ago, but with no ability to roll back, no way to confirm if that was the issue.

I transferred some money a few months ago to Webull just to get a promo. The past month I tried everything method possible to transfer my money out of my Webull account.

I tried linking my bank account, I got the mirco deposits but theres literally no way to verify it on Webull. I spent 2 hours looking on mobile and web and they say you can but theres actually no option anywhere.

I tried transferring to a debit card and other accounts, even made me provide bank statements. Which I did and it still doesn’t go through. 

I tried wiring the money, still wont let me. 

They literally wont let me take my money out. I’ve spent hours on the “Customer Service Number” they don’t answer ever. 

Like honestly It feels like Im being scammed, but I know Webull is supposed to be legit. But I can’t access my money at all and theres no Customer Support. 

I have never dealt with this before and literally have no idea what to do. I just want my money and to close this account but you can’t even do that!!!

Any Ideas??",m41lykw,webull,I am also out since last year. I had to pull out the money for some bills while I was finding a new job.

Even if you make money the gas fees and/or selling fees are so high it almost negates your wins if you’re not careful when you transfer. I also only have faith in BTC.

> Personally, I think they're expecting a crash and are afraid of everyone selling (non-meme stocks) and pulling their cash - which would force them into liquidation.

People selling would not force them into liquidation, company operating funds are segregated from client assets. If anything, they'd gain more revenue from FX fees.

>The fact that FSCS only guarantees security on £85k of assets is concerning. If your assets are frozen, three months is a long period of time to have to wait - a lot can happen.

FSCS protects you from bank failures, fraud etc - you're not protected from AML regulations. Again, though, irrelevant due to client asset segregation.

>If you're buying any shares, I'd recommend only buying them in your name from the official broker of the company (ie. Computershare). That's the only guarantee your assets will be secure.

What will happen after Oct 27th to thinkorswim desktop version?

Thanks",k2w6fl5,tdameritrade,"Stocks which commonly swing a high percentage of their value in a day are generally not suitable investment vehicles.   When looking at investing into individual companies, investors typically look for companies with relatively stable underlying financials.  The stock price for these companies are typically stable from day to day and only have wide swings in response to news affecting the company.   And,  as a general rule, they don't enter or exit when the price swings based on company news.

Whether you choose to believe it or not, buy and hold investing is alive and well.   Probably the only difference from 40 years ago is the advent of low cost index funds so many investors are now making choices about which ETF to buy based on market segments instead of individual stocks.  

One other thing about investors.  They also belive in the maxim ""time in the market beats timing the market"".   Generally a trader will believe that they can use lots of data to get a better return by timing their entry and exit.  An investor realizes that in the short term,  stock price movements are hard to predict and largely random.  As a result the investor will ignore the short term movements even entering and exiting and try to get in as soon as possible to capture as much as possible of the long term growth.   Statistically, it's better to enter as soon as possible versus waiting for a downturn which may or may not come.    Lots of studies have shown that lump sum investments beat DCA most of the time.",0,Pass_Little,0,1696097400,2023-09-30 18:10:00,30 September 2023

Do You Trust Your Fidelity Advisor?,1g87gn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1g87gn6/do_you_trust_your_fidelity_advisor/,"My account is barely a week old but I have already been given bad advice by my assigned Fidelity Advisor (he pushed me into using a CMA account to do BillPay and I realized after getting my rent money locked, calling them to ask about it, and then doing additional research here, that that was a mistake), and been forced to undo the mistakes he lured me into.

This entire thing could have been avoided if he had NOT deliberately changed my mind about using a Chase account instead, or if he had WARNED me that the account had several caveats that needed special attention (the 3-week delay on deposits leading to it needing an extra-long setup time), or if there was a big notice saying ""HEY YOUR FUNDS ARE STILL BEING HELD DONT USE BILLPAY YET"" on the BillPay page, or if they could have unlocked maybe 15% of the transferred funds when I called to ask, or if they were willing to reimburse the wire transfer fee my bank charges for me to transfer in more money to cover what I was trying to do.

But apparently none of that could be done, so, um.

Now I'm reconsidering some of my previous plans and reviewing everything else he said to me with a grain of salt, and I'd like to know how much you all trust your advisors in general and what my expectations should be.

Do they often give bad advice? What other kind of bad advice should I be wary of?

Do they ever give good advice, or should I generally ignore them and do my own research?

Your debit card isn't going to get here on time. There's a 3-5 week delay that they're not telling people about:

They give some reasons about *why* it's not going to be on time (they're busy addressing the fraud thing, they're changing the bank they use in the backend, other people signed up too much so there's a backlog), but at the end of the day what matters is:

**you're not gonna get your debit card anytime soon and they're giving people the runaround about it**

  
And for some accounts, all deposits into the money account have a **16 business-day delay before the money can be withdrawn or used for BillPay**, which they also haven't been clearly telling people about, while some accounts only have the 16 day delay for ACH pull transactions, but ACH push ones should have been faster. 

Which is frustrating and makes it hard to use for BillPay because 16 business days is 21 calendar days. So some people have been having trouble getting their bills paid on time, because that $5k deposit made on the 25th or whatever can't pay bills due on the 1st.",-1,Salty_Lawyer_9809,1,1729802991,2024-10-24 20:49:51,24 October 2024
eToro don't support 2FA while they think they do,1i5ptxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Etoro/comments/1i5ptxw/etoro_dont_support_2fa_while_they_think_they_do/,"eToro is an insecure platform that I would discourage using.

In order to secure your funds, real 2FA (two factor authentication), based on code generation through 2FA authenticator apps (or hardware), is critical to preventing unauthorized access to your account.

eToro however only allows for:
- SMS based 2FA, which is insecure as it assumes that the SIM card for the phone number receiving the SMS, is present only on the account holder's device, while these can be cloned / hacked
- Biometrics based _shorthands_ for logging in on the phone, such as Face ID.

Just contacted customer service at eToro with this issue.

They went so far as to suggest a bunch of 2FA apps, while they don't even support those on their platform! (It would require a feature that accepts the codes that these apps generate)

They even think enabling biometrics features in the mobile app, means 2FA apps will suddenly be supported. I did enable Face ID on my phone and of course this changed nothing as far as support for app based 2FA is concerned.

I'm baffled at the cluelessness of eToro regarding security matters and have closed my account in response.",m8cfrzx,Etoro,"It seems you are misleading here or mixing things or  got a bad explanation from their support. I read this in their help center and also experienced this myself in my account - 
eToro has 2FA with OTP (one-time password) via 3 channels: SMS, Phone and Push.

Push will work only after you will login with 2FA via SMS/Phone (not only credentials) on the Mobile App. Once it’s done, future 2FAs will be sent via Push, and the which is more secured then SMS (you are not exposed to SIM swap attacks etc.). From that point, your mobile app will get push (make sure you enabled Push notifications on your device). Try this and see it should work (try to login form desktop and you will get push to the mobile with OTP).

It’s indeed true that eToro is not offering an Authenticator app as a 2FA method / channel. I’ve also contacted their support on that and they advised it will be added at some point… let’s wait and see… 
But bottom line, they do support 2FA via SMS /Push OTP. I recommend to use Bio Login in case you don’t . It can be activated from settings.",1,GooliGool,3,1737466461,2025-01-21 13:34:21,21 January 2025

1099 Missing,1iq9r8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/moomoo_official/comments/1iq9r8f/1099_missing/,"I just joined moomoo halfway into last year and I have not received my 1099 yet. I'm wondering if it is because I do not have enough invested to warrant a 1099 being provided to me. (Perhaps I didn't get enough interest/dividends?)

I tried contacting customer service and they just gave me the list of dates, but maybe for some reason I am in a later wave. I need to know if I should push my tax appointment back or if I will not be getting one and can proceed filing my taxes.

So I wanted to ask if anyone here has already received theirs or not.",mdfx51d,moomoo_official,"Hi u/ibelieveingravity,

For a comprehensive guide on tax forms and reporting please see [Moomoo US Help Center-Tax](https://www.moomoo.com/us/support/categories/74?global_content=%7B%22promote_id%22%3A%2213764%22%2C%22sub_promote_id%22%3A%2221%22%7D)

There can be two reasons why a tax statement hasn’t been received:

The total amount of reportable income for the year, does not meet the minimum reporting thresholds (see below):

* 1099-B: All amounts are reportable
* 1099-INT: A total of at least $10 in reportable interest for line 1, 3 or 8
* 1099-DIV: At least $10 in dividends (including capital gains dividends and exempt-interest dividends) or other distribution on stock

The account is currently on holdback, as there are additional adjustments needed, and will be available no later than March 14, 2025.

Hope that helps! 🐮

I've never had fraud on my account but now I'm out of my fun money and can't touch it ;( ",lv7zi64,Fidelity,"Do you have online banking with your outside bank you hold your deposits with?? Good I'll help you :) 
Get on the official Online profile and look for transfers>bank to bank transfers. If this option is available then it will let you link your bank account TO fidelity directly for ACH/Direct deposit transfers. You're all set. 
If you have issues setting it up, call them because some banks might have issues during the authentication process. Mine did, but they happily worked around it for me. 
Once you have ACH deposits linked from your bank account you can transfer up to your banks limit..
If you exceed said limit, then you may wire transfer funds to fidelity. But the most cost effective, FAST AND SAFEST WAY NOW IS ACH TRANSACTIONS!!!!

Where to start with Roth IRA...help please.,1gkp1o4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1gkp1o4/where_to_start_with_roth_irahelp_please/,"I just deposited $8,000 into Fidelity to set up a Roth IRA. I want to get it invested somewhere where I can make money and chill. I don't want to sit on the website and look at stocks all day. But I want to get a good return on my investment. I have heard a lot of stuff about VOO. Forgive me for being ignorant, but I don't know where to begin with that.

",lvq88f2,Fidelity,"VOO and FXAIX are essentially the same (both are S&P 500 index funds), but FXAIX has slightly lower expenses so I would go with FXAIX, all the more so because you'll be holding a Fidelity fund in your Fidelity account.  This S&P 500 index fund is an excellent choice for a ""hands off"" long term investment, and especially good to steadily add more to each month.   You're basically buying the 500 largest companies listed on American stock exchanges, together with their ongoing earnings. 

That said, the market is at an all-time high right now, and even up sharply again today after yesterday's election.   I'd maybe wait a few days or maybe put in $2,000, and then $2,000 more next week and keep incrementally moving more into FXAIX to avoid putting it all in at what might be an upward spike.

Fractional Share Question,1b2thzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MerrillEdge/comments/1b2thzv/fractional_share_question/,"I am new to Merrill Edge and recently opened a self guided account to contribute to a Roth IRA. I know there are easier platforms to use, but I like all the research and education they provide and I get platinum rewards perks through Bank of America.

I'm ready to start converting the cash I recently moved into my Roth IRA to mutual funds. I know you can't buy fractional shares, but you do get them through dividend/capital gains reinvestment.

When going to buy mutual funds it asks me for a dollar amount, unlike buying stocks/etfs where it asks for the number of shares. What happens if I put in a dollar amount of say $100 for something that is $17.56/share, that turns into 5.69 shares? How do they handle the fractional share of 0.69, do they round up/down to the nearest whole share? Or am I better off putting in a dollar amount equal to the number of shares I want.",ksntlyx,merrilledge,"Unlike stocks, mutual funds are only priced once a day, so it is virtually impossible to buy a specific number of shares to guarantee a desired dollar value.

All accounts closed. Can't trade. Everything gone. No reason provided.,1jbbah6,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkorswim/comments/1jbbah6/all_accounts_closed_cant_trade_everything_gone_no/,"I am very confused on what just happened. I've been day trading for the past two weeks with TOS, and I am a new trader. Today, I woke up and tried to place trades and received messages:   
""order blocked for this account""

I call up Schwab/TOS, and they told me that all they see is a message that 'due to business decisions Schwab is exercising their right to close this account'

What just happened??? I didn't hack TOS, I didn't touch Schwab, I literally just had Schwab with money in it for the sole purpose of trading on TOS.

I have a feeling that I did something on TOS that broke some sort of rule. I was told about this by my friend, and I tried it myself just to see if it would work. Essentially, I go to day trade tiny penny stocks with less than 1 lot (like 20 shares) and if you cancel and replace the orders enough it'll quickly place the trade, buy it, and you can easily just go up and sell those 20 shares for like a total profit of 1 dollar per buy and sell. Stack that up with thousands of buys and sells you can get a good amount of money per day. 

I was making around 200+ USD with over 10,000 dollars used in Schwab per day. Did I break the rules? What do I do?",mip0099,thinkorswim,"If your main use for ThinkOrSwim is technical analysis, there's no need to endure the difficulties of obtaining a US account.

TD Ameritrade is beginning to charge users USD$50/month maintenance fees,16srut5,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/16srut5/td_ameritrade_is_beginning_to_charge_users/,"I've been one of TD Ameritrade's defenders after its acquisition by Charles Schwab. Over the better part of 3 years, I've been assured by TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab that the user experience is not going to change.

On the morning of 26 September 2023, TD Ameritrade customers in Singapore received an email stating that TD Ameritrade now intends to focus on Accredited Investors only, which are defined as individuals with:

* Personal income in excess of S$300,000 per year (or its equivalent in foreign currency)
* Net personal assets in excess of S$2,000,000 including residence (or its equivalent in foreign currency)
* Net personal financial assets in excess of S$1,000,000 (or its equivalent in foreign currency)

This expectedly excludes the large majority of retail investors.

**Beginning 27 October 2023,** **all remaining non-Accredited Investor accounts** will be charged a monthly account maintenance fee of USD$50. Accounts with balances less than USD$50 will only be charged an amount to reduce their cash balance to $0 (zero).

**As of U.S. market close on 1 December 2023**, non-Accredited Investor accounts will be restricted. We will no longer accept new trade orders to establish positions or deposits on any remaining accounts. However, you may still place liquidating orders to close positions.

**Starting at U.S. market open on 4 December 2023**, any remaining accounts (excluding those of Accredited Investors) with a debit balance (margin loan financed by securities lending) may have positions liquidated to bring these accounts to a zero or positive cash balance. We will no longer offer securities financing. 

Now Singapore is a small country that would be perfect as a sandbox to gauge the impact of a pivot in customer segments on TD Ameritrade's business. If it turns out well, I speculate that the pivot could be scaled to other markets as well.

Time to move to IBKR I guess.

u/EyeAteGlue pointed out that Schwab ceased operating in Singapore in 2019, so this could merely be a move to consolidate TDA's operations within their existing operations, which is fair and likely. This means TDA customers in localities without Schwab operations may want to consider alternative brokers.",k2asu5a,tdameritrade,"it's just sad that Charles Schwab would acquire TD Ameritrade only to amputate the main bulk of its customers, despite their repeated assurances that nothing would change from the user experience standpoint.",1,polymathicus,3,1695744299,2023-09-26 16:04:59,26 September 2023

Is this a risky pie in 5 years,1k032lf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k032lf,"I am totally new to investing and the biggest suggestion I got was ""diversity"". Based on past years performance, these are the companies I chose to invest in. However, I do feel a bit confuse with it..",mnemk2p,Trading212,"**Past performance isn't indicative of future performance**, however, a quick google search has J&J with only a 1.05% increase over the last five years... to me that's pretty poor growth over a 5-year period 🤷‍♀️ I'd probably be looking into reasons why that may be so that I had the full picture before committing (i.e., is there a competing company that's stealing potential profits from them? Any on going legal battles that have had impacts (talc powder allegations/financial settlements etc.) do you prefer potential steady growth over potential explosive growth?)

When investing in individual stocks, it's also important to be mindful of world politics / current climates of the world - your plan is to invest for 5-years, well, these are US companies and Trump is presumably going to be in power for at least 4 of those years, and given how gung-ho he seems to be on tariffs (or just the complete lack of predictability from him) you need to consider whether his impact may impact you and any potential stocks you may invest in...

Personally, since you say you're new I'd just whack your 5-year plan in an all-world ETF - it's largely US companies anyway so you'd be marginally investing in the stocks you've got there already, whilst being backed up by the rest of the world so to speak. So if Trump does what Trump does best and causes problems in the US, your loss may potentially be offset a little/you wouldn't be hit *as hard* because via the all-world ETF you've been investing in other countries at the same time...

Honestly, investing in individual stocks is the biggest risk imo, especially if you don't know what you're doing. If you *genuinely* want to invest in individual stocks you really need to do your due diligence. That means taking an interest in quarterly reports/financials, reading up on company prospects, keeping up to date with what's being published about them etc. and really being aware of global politics and having a clear understanding of how **everything** can impact the companies you've got money in.

And even after doing that / continuously keeping yourself in the loop, remember, **you still know nothing**.

Cut the stress and hassle - all-world ETF 😊

Edit: Also, technically, that's really not a diversified portfolio - you have 3 tech and 1 healthcare... all US based.",1,RandomGal98,1,1744810184,2025-04-16 13:29:44,16 April 2025

Advice - Looking into ETFs,1jyqrtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1jyqrtl/advice_looking_into_etfs/,"I am 56 years old.  
\- House fully paid  
\- No debts  
\- Room rented at $1350 a month  
\- Working 3 days a week part time  
\- Got another vacant room to rent out

I am looking at my tenant rental amount to buy US ETF monthly recurring over a 5 years period without dividend distribution and let it compound.   
  
**Goal:** Passive income (dividends)  
**Time Horizon:** Long-term (> 5 years)  
**Risk Tolerance:** Medium  
**Focus:** S&P 500 + Dividend-paying ETFs.

Afte some research, I have narrowed down to these 3 ETF. Would you say I am thinking in the right direction for retirement planning using the extra rental case to do something like this ?

Originally when I started out investing more than 10 years ago, when there was less localised investing advice, and cheap online brokerages (and VWRA) weren’t a thing yet, I invested in unit trusts at roughly 25% US, 25% Europe, 25% Asia, 25% SG. 

Over time, the US portfolio grew the most, Europe not too far behind, Asia and SG lagged by a lot. Of course I didn’t keep sticking to the same allocation over the years. The SG unit trust (it is designed to give stable monthly dividends but I have it set up to reinvest automatically) is now under 10% of my portfolio. But I like how it has been relatively stable over the years e.g. in 2022 S&P500 went down 18%, the SG side went up a smidge, and seeing the constant dividends I will likely increase my allocation to it when I retire. 

I have recently started dabbling in SG stocks directly. Have to say that individual stocks are rather volatile and I can’t resist trading them. With the lot size of 100, fees, and volatility, I think accumulating lots of individual SG stocks is not for me. The unit trust with monthly dividends will be way less stressful to manage.",-1,DuePomegranate,1,1744759265,2025-04-15 23:21:05,15 April 2025

Roast My Investing Strategy (or just feedback),1jv7bzk,https://i.redd.it/kjxokbunktte1.png,"**For context:** I'm 24 years old, live in the UK, and want to invest for the next 20-30 years. I'm a newbie when it comes to investing and don't intend to spend much time staying on top of news, so ideally want investments that I can DCA into and just set and forget (maybe adjusting every year or so at most).

My plan is to invest £250 per week into this portfolio. I wanted pretty heavy exposure to tech and Ai, but also some exposure to non-US markets too (hence the China Tech).

As I'm quite young, I don't want an excessively safe portfolio and want to be open to some higher-risk funds with the potential for slightly better returns, but I do have a pretty big crypto portfolio - so this is intended to be my 'safer' investments.

My own frustration stems from the fact that, essentially, the capabilities and services have been downgraded, i.e. *we're getting less tools in return for parking our money at Schwab*. Trashing account balance history was a pretty big one.

It's obviously not the representatives' fault. I sometimes have trouble remembering this... the front-line folks are on *our side*, and directly feel the pressure not only of questions they can't answer immediately, but also questions for which they know, absolutely, *that the answers are going to make some customers pretty upset*.

Maybe I'll drop some donuts off at my local branch...",k0agr9c,tdameritrade,"I've been very critical of Schwab reps and the trading platform in general, and I've already consolidated some of my accounts at Fidelity. But credit where credit is due. I had a very good experience with a Schwab rep on Friday concerning setup and activation of ToS on my trading account. He was polite, helpful, and walked me through the process, submitted a request to have ToS enabled for me, and said it would be up and running on Monday. In fact, ToS was ready to use on Sunday morning. I ha d a second interaction about checks for one of my accounts that should have arrived two weeks ago. That's obviously not his fault, and he looked into it, gave me an update, and assured me the check would arrive this week, and if not, call back and they'll deal with it. Perhaps things will begin to normalize as time goes by.",1,NightWriter007,6,1694542273,2023-09-12 18:11:13,12 September 2023
Can't find a single issue with the transition to Schwab using Desktop TOS,1cr4mfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/1cr4mfa/cant_find_a_single_issue_with_the_transition_to/,I've been trading since market open 3.5 hours ago.

I will post if I find anything else different. I see a LOT of comments with issues but count them and then consider millions were switched. I post this so people will understand that the bad issues are not the norm.,l8hgi77,tdameritrade,"Well, it's been a month and there are lots of issues. For example, I have a cash account but Schwab lets me spend way beyond the balance then tells me the next day that they'll restrict me to only settled cash if I do it again. TDA never let me go beyond my balance on the cash account. As a scalper, I don't have time to calculate what's left second by second. I go until the broker tells me I'm done. Never a problem in 15 years with TDA. Schwab immediately a problem.

My opening balance is always the opening balance from the previous day thus all transactions show a running balance that's false. No one seems to be able to fix it. They wanted to remote in to see for themselves (like they can't see it on their end). I let them and wow, it is wrong! So, they'll send some note to someone somewhere and . . . forget it.

I had a .62 buystop set on an OTO and it filled @ .96! Seriously??? .34 slippage! Never, ever in 15 years @ TDA did I get more than a few cents. The OTO converted to an OCO with a stop .10 down and profits @ .10 and .20 up. The price went to 1.34 with no fills. Then it turned and crashed to under .50. My stops supposedly triggered at .64 and .65. Customer services sucks. They told me at their end they can tell me ""millisecond by millisecond"" how the trade went and that it didn't reach the exchange until it was already at .75. Lies. It was placed 47 seconds before the move even began. And even if it was already .75, where was the sellstop .10 and .20 later? All that should have triggered for profit, not loss.

1% wealthsimple match offer not being paid out anymore! what? need help.,1jdcjo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wealthsimple/comments/1jdcjo5/1_wealthsimple_match_offer_not_being_paid_out/,"I got an email saying :

We’re letting you know your net deposits have fallen below the threshold required for the Wealthsimple 1% Match Offer, and, as a result, you no longer qualify for the bonus per the promotion's terms and conditions. A friendly reminder that you need to maintain 100,000.00 (fictional number) net amount amount in your Wealthsimple account(s) for 365 days after the end of your Offer Period, which for you is July 10, 2025.

The thing is I am 30k ABOVE the net amount they claim I need to be, so I called them up asking to understand this and apparently, the amount I transferred for the 1% promotion (my entire TFSA) is only valid if I keep ALL the money I already had in my WS account prior to the transfer?! what!?, meaning the money that was already there PRIOR to the amount I transferred for the promotion included even though **its not eligible for the 1%**, has to be present and accounted for? not just the transferred amount for the promotion?? what kind of scam is this??

This means that if I had NO money in WS prior to transferring my TFSA I would have been fine?

Edit: got off the phone with support, apparently they fucked up and are investigating.",mi98a3s,Wealthsimple,"Yup. They do the calculation as ALL WS assets + transfer balance = Qualified amount. If you take out 5% of trasnfer balance, against your qaulified amount, it starts being affected. Its a gatcha thing after I read the TOS and was trying to understand if moving it around would affect it (it didnt), but it effectively holds your non associated to the promo funds hostage.

  
So original balance is 100k. You transfer in 100k. Qualified balance is 200k. 5% of 100k is 5k. You take out 200-10 = 190k. You now get \~90% of the match (i dont actually know, but its likely close.

I had made my first withdrawal through ACH transfer after investing for about a year on the 12th. Yesterday I got a notification saying the withdrawal is completed. The amount didn’t reflect in my bank account. Upon reaching out to customer care they asked me to verify with bank. Called the bank they could see no such deposit.

Can you explain where the discrepancy comes from? I've come across other retail trading apps that use customer cash to meet the requirements under SEA Rule 15c3-3 to take on more debt. Is this what Moomoo does as well? Meaning the 1-3 business days for a wire indicates that how long it takes Moomoo to unwind customer funds from the omnibus account they are used in?

Physiological Aid for Long-term Investor During Bumpy Times,1jrvsco,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1jrvsco/physiological_aid_for_longterm_investor_during/,"I started investing in November 2023 and have gradually invested about 75% of the money I’d saved over the years into index funds, metal ETFs, a few bonds, and a few individual stocks. My goal is long-term investing (20+ years), and I plan to continue DCA’ing into index funds along the way. Last year was an exceptional time for the markets, and I definitely got caught up in the hype. I found myself spending way too much time reading economic news and obsessively checking my portfolio.

Over the past couple of months (especially this past week), I’ve lost most of the gains I made last year. I haven’t sold anything, and I fully understand that these kinds of drawdowns are part of the journey for long-term investors. What’s been tough, though, is the mental side. I’ve been struggling with this “losing mindset” — it just hurts. Seeing weekly losses that are several times my salary honestly makes me feel sick.

I’d really appreciate hearing from those of you who went through the COVID crash (or many previous ones). How did you cope with the feeling of seeing years of gains vanish in such a short time? What helped you stay disciplined and focused — or even just mentally detach for a while?

Edit: Thanks for the advice, everyone! And sorry for the typo earlier — I meant psychological. Just to give a bit more context: I have a stable job, a solid emergency fund, and some additional cash set aside to add during market corrections. Index funds make up a significant portion of my portfolio.

Right now, I’m mostly trying to figure out how to mentally detach. I’ve been checking my portfolio way too often, and that habit is really feeding the emotional ups and downs. Would love to hear how others have managed to break that cycle.",mlmima3,singaporefi,"I think... 2024 wasnt an exceptional year because through my lens it is just a normal year. This year... Is also a normal year.

If I am right you are trying to get a sense whether it is normal for your gains to be wiped out. Yes it is norma if you adopt a buy and hold, strategic portfolio strategy.

Markers don't go up in a straight line.

Dimensional fund advisers have a returns matrix book. We sometimes use it to show clients the uniqueness of returns. You are able to see positive annualised returns then negative annualised returns then go back positive.

I won't be able to describe as well as the book.

You can see the book here: https://www.newcapitalmgmt.com/s/matrix-book-2024-us.pdf

Each pyramid shows the annualised returns of various market indexes over time.

One aspect about coping is also to think about what is it that you think you  understood about your strategy but now have doubts. And I think many didn't really understand how different the returns can be.

The returns in the book go to periods where regimes have changed like the 1970s or before the 1950s where it has been challenging.

It should show you volatility and uncertainty, returns being wiped out is feature you give to get the returns.

If so, if you review the philosophy, were there any thing that took you by surprise? Take this moment to reflect and find out the answer.

My portfolio also got it's two year old gains wipe out to the tune of $184,000.

 \* cash set aside enough for 6 months spending

Our expense expected to run at $42,000/year (On assumption we cash out our condo and move to HDB hence no more mortgage payment). Considering at 3.5% SWR, the FIRE number is $1,200,000.00. we just need simple lifestyle.

My question is does FIRE number includes ALL assets or just liquid? i.e does my CPF amounts adds it to it? I like to FIRE soonest possible but I’m not sure if there is any blind spot not taken into consideration. Am i ready? Any advice greatly appreciated.",mmjeqki,singaporefi,"Took me awhile to figure out what you are doing. 

You will sell the condo and move back into the HDB, so there will be no more rental income. And you have correctly excluded the HDB property value that you will be living in from your total, for the purposes of FIRE.

It would have been clearer to express the sales proceeds of your condo minus outstanding loan, which becomes investible cash? Basically you will have existing $350K investments plus $450K investible cash, and your wife will have $450 investible cash. I'm neglecting fees associated with the sale, HDB reno and moving etc, but you should probably budget that in.

So together, you have 1.25M investible money. There might be some complication of having to pay back your CPF OA and accrued interest, but we can assume that you will be able to invest the CPF OA in Amundi Index MSCI World or whatever so it can grow in there. 

Whatever is in your SA, you can consider as extra backup. I personally would not consider MA as part of my FIRE number as medical expenses will increase in age (which isn't accounted for in your current expenses) and you will slowly deplete your MA. 

You can also count SA as part of the 50% bonds component of the 50-50 portfolio that SWR framework is based on. 

If you have already set aside your kid's uni fees (excluded from this table), then I think you are ok to FIRE, keeping a careful eye on expenses. 

Do have a closer look at 1) what needs to go back into CPF after selling the condo, and 2) costs associated with selling and moving. Your money outside of OA and SRS needs to be substantial enough that you can safely draw down on it from now until age 55.",1,DuePomegranate,9,1744366562,2025-04-11 10:16:02,11 April 2025

BEWARE Trading212 will refuse to refund clear fraudulent transactions on the virtual card,1jcpw8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/trading212/comments/1jcpw8y/beware_trading212_will_refuse_to_refund_clear/,"# TLDR: 

Trading212 allowed two fraudulent transactions (£130 to ""ROYAL BOROUGH OF GREEN"" & £315.44 to ""TRAVELODGE WEBSITE"") to be charged on my account. Despite evidence that I don't live in Greenwich nor booked hotels in the past, they're refusing to refund me on the false claim that I made the payments using my iPhone 13 and on the claim that POS-type transactions can't be chargebacked.

\-------

Yesterday, I opened my Trading212 account and noticed two highly suspicious transactions, £130 to ""ROYAL BOROUGH OF GREEN"" and £315.44 to ""TRAVELODGE WEBSITE"". Both payments **appear** **one minute apart (12:27 PM & 12:28 PM) in my transaction statement** and were made on March 14. The 1 minute apart thing should already be cause for suspicion and in my opinion enough proof that I am not the one authorising these crazy payments. But on top of that, there were two more inconsistencies: 1. the app (not the transaction statement, but the interface) showed the transactions being made at 18:49 PM & 19:28 PM respectively, 2. the customer service agent I spoke to claimed the transactions were instead made at 20:49 PM & 21:28PM respectively (Perhaps the customer agent was in a timezone two hours ahead of me?)

In spite of providing the customer service agent with proof that it would've been physically not possible for me to have authorised those transactions (I was in a uni lecture and then in a uni society gathering during all of the transaction times) they did not help me submit a chargeback.

At this point I literally had to start begging them. I told them I have absolutely no connections to these payments as I don’t live in Woolwich/Greenwich, so why would I be paying for a borough service there? (They have my registered address on file...)

On top of this I never received any SMS, email notification, to verify the large payments. Clearly this is some sort of security failure? Every time I have made a large purchase in the past using the Trading212 card, I have had to open my Trading212 app and get it approved. (The customer agent also insinuated that someone must have gotten hold of my account details due to my negligence. Clearly this would not have been the case or else all the money in my account would be gone...) So why did I not have to approve the payment this time?  Which leads me to the next point...

The transaction was apparently a POS type, which was the customer agent's main argument for not refunding. They said based on this fact, I \*must\* have been the one certifying the payments. This is again false because I only have my iPhone 13 linked to the virtual card and it was with me the whole time. So clearly, it was not some sort of in-person payment. The very fact that the payments were marked POS, which is usually used for in-person payments, despite me not paying for these fraudulent payments inperson, suggests the fraudster intentionally used POS to **prevent a chargeback from being processed.** Btw, all the other legitimate payments on my account show up as ""Online - Recurring"" as I assume legitimate businesses settle their transactions periodically and not instantaneously.

# Trading212’s response?

* They are refusing to issue a chargeback despite the overwhelming evidence.
* They haven’t explained why the payments were labeled as POS despite all the other legitimate businesses' transactions being ""Online - Recurring""
* They haven’t explained why there was no verification request

My response has been to submit an official complaint and have reported this to the Action Fraud police unit as well. So far it seems like I am not being taken too seriously, as the Action Fraud closed my case at 3AM (presumably with some AI detector) saying identity theft is not a police reportable crime.

The lesson I've learnt is not to trust Trading212 with my money. Sadly I have experienced similar debit card fraud back when I lived in Hong Kong - my bank HSBC helped me refund the money no problem, so no excuse why Trading212 cannot do the same. For now, I have withdrawn all my money from the invest part. Thoughts on whether I should also remove all my cash ISA money?",mi5pjy7,Trading212,"Banks in my country are absolutely terrible, no interest and no cashback.

Withdrawing dollars in etoro to my Revolut dollar account,1ewsuq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Etoro/comments/1ewsuq2/withdrawing_dollars_in_etoro_to_my_revolut_dollar/,"I would like to withdraw my etoro cash balance, which is in dollars, to my Revolut dollar account. By doing this, I hoped to keep my fees low, and then use Revolut to convert from dollars to sterling, at a better exchange rate.

So, I tried to set this up on etoro and it wouldn't let me. I had to use customer support. They want all my bank details, SWIFT number etc. Initially they said their are no fees, but when I queried them about the SWIFT system often charging fees for using the SWIFT network, they changed their answer. They said this:

In case of a USD transfer, note that all bank transfers in USD (to banks outside the US) need to be routed through a US intermediary bank. This is a requirement of the US government in order to control their currency. These fees are beyond our control.  
  
As such, banks generally charge a fee per transaction, but it is not a fixed amount and we cannot give you an estimate prior to the withdrawal being fully processed. These fees charged by such banks are generally around 25 USD per transaction, though this can be up to 75 USD in some rare cases.

So now I don't know what to do. Will I get hit with higher fees by trying to withdraw my etoro dollar cash balance to my Revolut dollar account? I am based in the UK, if that makes any difference.

Anyone have answers for this?",lj0zsc5,Etoro,"When I topped up etoro through Revolut by doing an USD transfer, there were no fees.

When I did it through a local bank and not revolut, there was a 35 dollars fee taken by the intermediary banks.

Maybe withdrawing through Revolut shouldn't take any fees, it depends on the routing that Etoro will have for the transfer through Revolut.

Try once, see how it goes. If there are fees, then next time just exchange it to eur/gbp on etoro and withdraw it through etoro money.

I’m just looking for some clarification, as I’ve never filed taxes before. ",mf01q9z,Wealthsimple,"I am not a tax expert, but it's treated as capital gains income. The tax rate depends on your total income for the year you sell - 2025 - in this case. You can go to Wealthsimple tax calculator online for 2024, choose Alberta,  and plug in your numbers.  It gives an estimate of total taxes and your average and marginal tax rate. You don't log in to use this estimator.

If 1500 in capital gains is your total income for the year, you will pay $0 tax. Lets say you make 30k working,  then you would owe $4297. When I add $1500 capital gains, your tax bill goes up to $4484, a difference of $187. So your tax bill on the gains won't be too high. It really depends on all of your income. 

You should be filing taxes because you will benefit from government credits like gst and climate rebate (until this is canceled).

You can also look at taxtips.ca where there is a detailed tax calculator to estimate your annual tax bill. There is a chart showing the tax rates by province and source (dividends, gains, regular income). I hope this helps",0,sandray_animal_lover,1,1740622449,2025-02-27 2:14:09,27 February 2025

My questions for all of you is that what makes you staying with Freetrade (ISA)?

My main complaints with Freetrade are:

1. Expensive comparing to Trading 212. High FX fees for trading Non-uk stocks.  £6/month ISA fees vs £0/month on trading 212
2. a lot less equities and ETFs on offer. over 6000s on freetrade vs over 12000s on trading 212
3. App lacks features and constantly malfunctions. currency exchange, demo account, after hour trading, copytrading etc for those who needs it. The features on Freetrade app is just very basic. Also Trading 212 has a much better desktop site than freetrade

I am not shilling for trading 212 at all, both products are directly competing with each others and have a lot of similiarities. In my opinion, trading 212 provides better value and product for investors.

What do you all think? is there any red flags about trading 212 i should be aware of before switching?

How important is margin rate?,1f26ckp,https://www.reddit.com/r/moomoo_official/comments/1f26ckp/how_important_is_margin_rate/,"I noticed that moomoo offers a very competitive margin rate, significantly lower than other brokers. However, I've primarily been investing in ETFs and don't fully understand how margin rates work. Can someone explain the importance of margin rates and how they function? Thanks!",lk5y9t8,moomoo_official,"Hi u/appnanoooo5,

Thanks for the question and thanks to u/Mocserismi for the helpful example.

First of all, you need a margin account to have a margin loan.  If you have a margin account, you don't have to borrow funds, but it gives you that ability.  You cannot borrow funds in a cash account.  Both account types are available at Moomoo.

Margin trading is buying securities with borrowed funds, using the assets in your account as collateral.  In much the same way that a bank can lend you money if you have equity in your house, your brokerage firm can lend you money against the value of your investments. Stocks have both initial margin requirements and maintenance margin requirements.

The margin rate is the interest rate on the margin loan.  So, it is a very important factor if you decide to borrow funds. Moomoo has one of the lowest rates in the industry.

Because margin creates leverage, it is increasing the potential for gains, but it is also increasing the potential for losses, so please consider and fully understand the risks before buying stocks on margin.

For more information, check out our help center topic on margin trading [moomoo US Help Center-What are margin trading and short selling](https://www.moomoo.com/us/support/topic4_240?from_platform=4&platform_langArea=us&global_content=%7B%22promote_id%22%3A%2213764%22%2C%22sub_promote_id%22%3A%2221%22%7D).

Want to change Global Settings so that all TRAILSTOPs start at -$.10,1i53xtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkorswim/comments/1i53xtk/want_to_change_global_settings_so_that_all/,"As the title says, I want to change the default value of a TRAILSTOP order from -$.50 to -$.10 in ThinkorSwim (TOS).  TOS seems to default to -$.50, and I can't figure out how to change that.

Here's why I'm looking for this from a strategy perspective:  I like to scalp options plays in fast-moving underlying stocks like TSLA.  I use order templates with fixed quantities and my STOPLOSS set at a predetermined point.  Upon entering the trade, I immediately look for directional profitability, which I usually have.  At that point, I click ""Cancel/Replace Order"" to start moving my STOPLOSS closer to the price, but to also change from the STOPLOSS to a TRAILSTOP order to capture quick profit on the movement before a reversal.

The problem:  When I click on the word ""STOP"" in my change order ticket to bring up a list that contains TRAILSTOP, and I select TRAILSTOP to change to it, the order ticket updates (as it should) but ***always*** defaults to a -$.50 TRAILSTOP.  At that point, I have to manually change that to -$.10, with a couple of keystrokes since the up/down arrow buttons only change the stop by $.01 per click.  Thus, I would like to have -$.10 be the default so that I don't have to keep changing the order ticket in the heat of the moment as I've made a mistake doing so in the past that cost me.

Is there a way to do this?  I keep reading the TOS help pages and numerous posts around the web that try to answer my question, but none seem to work to change that basic setting across ALL order entry tickets.

Thank you for your help!",m868ttz,thinkorswim,"UPDATE:  
After 20 minutes in an online chat with the trade desk at Schwab, and after them trying to send me to the same places as the suggestions here, it was determined that this feature is locked within the program.

The support guy, David, suggested a login to the web version of TOS and provide feedback through a link at the top of the homepage, but that doesn't create a support ""ticket"" or ""order"" of any kind, only provides a suggestion to the development team that someone is interested in being able to set the default ""WIDTH"" of a Trailstop order ticket so they don't have to change it manually each time it pops up.  
Perhaps, I'll fool around with a Template and see how it works, but running through the process in my mind tells me that it's going to be nearly as cumbersome as changing it in the ticket itself.",-1,CapeFearElvis,1,1737387019,2025-01-20 15:30:19,20 January 2025

Charles Schwab Fraudulent Scam Calls from 888-403-9000,1ien5up,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlesSchwab/comments/1ien5up/charles_schwab_fraudulent_scam_calls_from/,"This is now the second time I have received a fraudulent call from this number. Although this time they were thankfully unsuccessful. Schwab lists this number they called from 888-403-900 under ""Banking & Mortgage
Schwab Client Banking Services""
888-403-9000
https://www.schwab.com/contact-us
Caller ID even shows the regular ""Charles Schwab"" text. 

Needless to say, an individual calls claiming they are a fraud agent from Schwab reporting on fraudulent charges. Both times in California (Lancaster for some reason). First time they claimed it was a wire transfer of $1500, this time it was $200 at the dollar store and $2100 at Best Buy. The first time (November last year) when I fell for it unfortunately, they began sending texts from what seems like Schwab automated fraud report. Some of which happen before the fraud call, some happen during. The second time, I never got any texts prior to the call, but I did receive texts from ""Schwab"" during the call. To which they will say ""Was this you reply yes or no?"" The guy on the phone the second time  just seemed, off, not like your regular agent. One of the biggest red flags was this guy named specific items bought in one of the supposed transactions ""Three IPhone 15's and 2 MacBook pros"" I immediately knew, this guy is not legit, but how is he calling from a verified Schawb number. 

I told him I am going to call the main Scwhab line and speak with their fraud department on my own accord directly. To which he gets all flustered ""Oh this is entirely legitimate, you are completely secure blah blah blah."" A regular Schwab agent would have almost encouraged you to do this, not prevent it. Following the first time this happened back in November, Schwab told me to hang up and call their main number 877-519-1403 if we ever have doubts and just want to be extra cautious if we ever feel we are unsure about who we are speaking to. So that's exactly what I did. When I called Schwab, they're like ""Uuh yeah, nothing happening over here, we show no calls to you or any fraudulent activity."" So I verified nothing was going on, but regardless, the fact that a Charles Schwab number (888-403-9000) is somehow and I don't know how, getting hacked and used by scammers. This marks twice I have been called by that number and have spoken to someone trying to scam me, November 1st, 2024 and today January 31st, 2025. Thankfully, it didn't work the second time around. But this is genuinely scary. I'm not sure who or where to go to in order to report this number to Schwab as a huge security risk that has been obviously exploited. This is purely for PSA and safety awareness.

I encourage anyone and everyone to impart any advice you have on things to look out for, or even your own experience and mistakes you've learned from regarding these matters, just as I have. Stay safe and stay informed out there folks! ",ma938po,CharlesSchwab,"This is known as spoofing. Glad you caught on to their tactics. They can spoof any number in existence to make it look like it’s coming from a legitimate company on the caller ID.

Deposit Taking more than 25 DAYSSS to clear,1ggp3dx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1ggp3dx/deposit_taking_more_than_25_daysss_to_clear/,"I made my usual deposit of $700 and wondered why I couldn't trade it. I called today and was told my deposit hold time is over 20 days time. The money has been released by my bank, and Fidelity has it but I can't use it because of a TikTok about fraud. I've never had fraud on my account but now I'm out of my fun money and can't touch it ;( ",lvj1y6q,Fidelity,"Exactly you got it!
So a direct ACH from your bank works as a workaround because compared to what we usually use (direct transfer EFTs initiated by fidelity) use a different verification process than ACH transfers. An ACH transfer from your bank to fidelity will usually debit the amount you request immediately for transfer to clear the funds before sending (putting the liability only on the outside institution) and the bank pushes your deposits for you to fidelity, some within 1-3 business days depending on traffic but since I began using ACHs my money has been received sometimes by the end of the same business day and cleared for investing and withdrawals immediately as it's already cleared funds from my bank. 😁

I'm almost certain you can use this method yourself in your situation but if you don't have a secondary fidelity account to make the deposits and initiate contributions I recommend opening one or speaking to a fidelity rep and ask if contributions can be made directly in that way for now. 

Hope this workaround can benefit you in some way!!",0,Local_Stick3627,2,1730818046,2024-11-05 14:47:26,05 November 2024

Fid closed all my accounts during hurricane Helene and refuses to give reason,1g3whb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1g3whb9/fid_closed_all_my_accounts_during_hurricane/,"TL;DR: I'm a hurricane Helene victim and while I've had no power for 14 days, Fidelity closed all of my accounts, including retirement accounts, without notifying me in any way or giving me any reason or recourse. You've been warned! And shame on you, Fidelity, for giving me false information and completely failing to inform me of your actions on my accounts. Long story: I've had a Fidelity CMA joint account for parking cash plus a couple Roth accounts for my son and I for almost a year now. All of my credit card/other bills come out of my Fid account and I've always been very happy with their customer service. Three weeks ago, I noticed an unusually long hold time of almost a month on a couple incoming ACH transfers; when I called to inquire, they said because of industry-wide fraud, they were temporarily changing their settlement times on incoming funds to 21+ days, and they recommended wiring money in to pay my immediate bills. The Fid rep I talked to recommended cancelling my incoming transfers so I could get the funds in in a more efficient way, like pushing them in from external accounts vs. pulling them in via Fid, so I did that. ... (cont. in comments)",lrz16hd,Fidelity,"A few hours later, I got an automated email from Fidelity saying my billpay was canceled, so I called back to inquire and they said there was now a fraud restriction on the account probably due to the cancelled transfers (that Fid themselves recommended due to the circumstances and themselves cancelled).  I called back the next morning and spoke to a fraud services rep for an hour, who went thoroughly through my account, asked lots of questions, and told me not to worry, that they saw their system put an automatic flag on my account due to the transfers they canceled. They asked why I'd had so many ACH transfers lately and I explained that I'd had to scramble to move money because of their new 21+ day funds settling policy (and because I was just about to go out of town), otherwise my bills that come out of that account would have bounced. After an hour, the rep assured me that everything was ""good to go"" and that my account was ""all good"" and he removed the fraud flag. When I try to use my ATM card a few days later, it declines, and when I called in after the hurricane desperately needing to access my cash, Fid told me all of my accounts have been closed and they are not able to give any reason. To this day, they have yet to inform me of the account closures in any way - letter, email, or phone - other than me just calling in myself and them telling me they decided to close the accounts and that they do not have to tell me the reason. So I have been stuck in a catastrophic disaster without power for 14 days trying to deal with Fid who locked up my funds and closed my accounts without informing me. Unfortunately, my experience with Fidelity has turned from 98% positive into 100% negative. Be warned!",-1,Fit-Professional6053,12,1728956197,2024-10-15 1:36:37,15 October 2024

WARNING: FidelityRewards Card (Elan) DOES NOT offer 2FA security,1e1lyrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1e1lyrm/warning_fidelityrewards_card_elan_does_not_offer/,"TLDR: My personal information was exposed in a recent third-party breach.  Someone called in to Elan this morning and a phone agent there happily changed the phone number on my account for them.

I got the email, immediately logged in and changed everything (password, loginID, etc.), locked the card, etc. then called FidelityRewards.

Two things I learned:

1/ There are no additional security verification measures that can be added to prevent phone changes (other companies use a ""safe word"" or ""verbal code).  Anyone with your personal information can change it and Elan will just happily go along.

2/ Is it not possible to enable ANY form of 2FA security on the FidelityRewards card website.  None.

A major financial institution (Elan) with another financial institutions backed-card (Fidelity) and 2FA isn't even an option, nor is any additional security to dialing in available.

Disgusting.",les7kid,Fidelity,"I'm not so sure about risk-based passive analysis.  When it gets it wrong, it seems like no one can do anything about it.

  
For example, Ally Bank had a freakout about my identity.  They won't tell me what happened, just that the 3rd party system they (and a lot of banks according to them) decided there is a problem.  And no one can do anything about.  I solved that problem by moving my financial hub to a Fidelity CMA, but when the system can shut you down and there is no way to tell it that it made a mistake, it is a mess.",-1,InevitableTouch0,1,1721860942,2024-07-24 22:42:22,24 July 2024

Fidelity EFTs Take 3-4 weeks to clear,1fpacn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1fpacn3/fidelity_efts_take_34_weeks_to_clear/,"Since r/fidelityinvestments removed both my original post and my followup, I'll post it here in hopes that it gets to hang around somewhere:

In one quick move, you eliminated the trust I've built up in Fidelity over 16 years of doing business with you. You deleted my post (via rule #10 - we do what we want) which was the only way that customers could know they will not be able to withdraw funds for 3-4 weeks when they send them into fidelity via EFT. There is NO other notification that funds will be unavailable this long and, while we're fortunately able to handle this, many customers will rely on these funds for rent, groceries, etc. and can't handle their money being unavailable for 7-10 times as long as the app says. Linking me to a megathread is useless, because many/most of your customers do not use reddit and I just want you to give them a heads up before they count on you to have their money available in 3-4 days, AS YOUR APP SAYS. Ban me if you will. Next time I encounter an issue with Fidelity, I'm moving my money elsewhere, because this is pathetic customer service to just remove a post instead of saying ""thanks for the feedback - let's fix that"". I don't see a single useful reply from y'all in that thread either. Original post:

I chatted with fidelity and they informed me that a large deposit (for me - $12,500) would not settle for 3 weeks from the date of deposit. This differed from a recent deposit of similar size and also a deposit I'd made since then of ~$4,500. The app still says that deposits will be available 3-4 days after submission, so please be aware this may happen to you & Fidelity, please update the app (and presumably website) to make this clear.",lpb0bs4,Fidelity,"There's an insane amount of check kiting going on due to Tik Tok and for a while Fidelity was being hit by a ton of fraud and so in response they have dialed back their consumer friendliness to about the minimum required by law.

Based on another comment it looks like at least one of these studies is using a smoothing method.

Another thing is different brokers have different market data. They are not all the same. It’s because different brokers have deals with different exchanges for their data. Not all data is created equal and there’s frequently differences between broker market data, which then will affect your study.

Third, the studies are each using different box sizes, and that will obviously affect how the plot comes across on the screen. If you’re gonna compare studies across software, make sure you size the plot area exactly the same on each, so you have a better picture of the difference",0,Bostradomous,1,1732287620,2024-11-22 15:00:20,22 November 2024

 so i went over and tried my schwab login.   that worked.  however, now the program ONLY pulled up my schwab accounts.  however, they all say ""this account is not authorized to trade in thinkorswim"".

so i click and try to follow the guide to 'enable trading in think or swim"", and that doesn't work.

edit: nope.  this did not help me.  i was able to find the gear and exact thing you mentioned, but it did not work for me.  it would seem my TD account is completely un-accessible through think or swim.  thankfully i don't need to make any big changes in my account and will be working from home tomorrow.

edit2:  ok, very odd.  i tried the steps that OP menteioned again.  i wanted to get the error, and the phone number to call.  but.....this time they worked.  i was able to log into my TD account on think or swim, can see all the positons just like before, etc.

- logged into schwab account (wasn't able to do anything), logged out
- logged into ""paper money schwab account"" (didn't do anything, so i logged out)
- logged back into live, schwab account, didn't do anything, logged out

My Journey to find a Broker other than Schwab,16vlchf,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/16vlchf/my_journey_to_find_a_broker_other_than_schwab/,"**Forward**: This describes my journey looking for a broker to replace my automated move to Schwab from TDA. These are my thoughts and opinions and I'm not endorsing (as in gaining any monetary benefit) any one broker or service over another.

**The beginning**: I was scheduled to be moved from TDA to Schwab November 3, 2023. I signed up for a Schwab account early and put $50 in it so I could use/try out the trading software.

AT first, I was OK being moved as we were told we would be able to use TOS. While TOS seems to now be available to Schwab users, I find that is just not enough to put up with their otherwise ""horrible software"".

**What I want in a broker**

To be clear about what I was looking for in a broker, I want high option level approval and good software, margin approval, fast trades, and a fricking interface to open into like the TDA start page (Good luck on that!).

Plus, the whole damn thing needs to be usable and not require 20 clicks to find watchlists, option tables (all of them - not just a few dates), my current investments and my net worth, and Hey Schwab! How about some colors - green for up, red for down, we would all really appreciate that! Needless to say, these things and many more features were available on the TDA home page.

**The Brokers I Tried - Not a rundown of all their features, just good and bad points.**

**Schwab** \- One look at their desktop trading and phone app and you start thinking that they cater to 90-year-old buy and hold customers. If they didn't grab TOS from TDA, I don't know how anyone could actually trade options with their software.

**Tasty Trade** \- **Good**: It works OK **Bad**: Didn't like the interface. It's too simple in some ways and too complicated in other ways - esp. the option screen.

**IBKR** \- I tried these guys a few years ago. My impression was they were like desktop TOS - the info is in there if you want to dig it out. I didn't want to dig it out - next.

**Robinhood -** I tried this because some of the TDA guys that were **""let go""** went to work here\*\*. Good\*\* It's simple\*\*. Bad -\*\* It's too simple and too many ads imbedded in the screens. One option lets you put emojis on your trading screen. Hmmmm.

**TradeStation - This is the broker I chose - HOWEVER -- see update below. The reasons:**

1. They actually have customer service you can talk to\*\*.\*\* Schwab was the only other broker you could call and talk to someone in a reasonable amount of wait time.
2. You can trade with them directly in the TradingView app. For some reason I have been using TradingView more and more - esp. since informed that Schwab wanted to annex my account.
3. I have option level 5 with them. They like me and want me to lose my money quicker.
4. Their web software can do everything I need it to do and is very similar to TOS web in function and appearance.
5. A so-so is their desktop app is similar to desktop TOS. It's there if you have the time and want to mess with it.

 **Update October 24, 2023** \- I moved my IRA to TradeStation about 3 weeks ago but I did not move my main trading account as I wanted to see how things worked at TradeStation. It only took 5 work days to transfer my IRA to TradeStation which was good, However, after using their mobile, web, and desktop apps, I am not happy with them. About the only advantage TradeStation really has over Schwab for me is a higher option approval level and that just doesn't make up for their sub-par software.

Currently, my main account will move to Schwab on 3 November. I am staying with Schwab as I can always do my options trades on mobile ToS - which is as good as any other mobile option capable app out there. I have some money at Robinhood and at IBKR, but at this time I don't see them as a destination for my main account.

I didn't realize how difficult it would be to replace TDA and after a month of searching I don't think its possible.

Good luck to all transferees. I hope you find or make a home as good as TDA.",k2srfr8,tdameritrade,"Thanks for the explanation. I also trade options frequently, but it sounds like you've gotten used to the TDA site and weren't using TOS much. I use TOS exclusively, so as long as TOS is available at Schwab, and not crippled, it sounds like those of us who use TOS will be fine.",0,ripp84,5,1696032616,2023-09-30 0:10:16,30 September 2023

I am annoyed with Fidelity's overly aggressive deposit holds. Time for a CFPB complaint?,1hpg8wk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1hpg8wk/i_am_annoyed_with_fidelitys_overly_aggressive/,"I have been a Fidelity customer for over 10 years, and I have several accounts of various types with them (Roth, 401K, cash management, UTMA, IRA). 

I recently placed a somewhat large transfer to my brokerage account (>$10K <$50K), and they have frozen the funds until January 17th, which will be more than 6 weeks.

While I understand they have 'increased incidents of fraud' their approach does not seem to be logical or fact based.

Some things to consider:

My account is not new. 

The account I am transferring these funds from is also not new. 

I have made similar transactions between these same institutions in the past.

The total value of accounts owned by me is several times the amount that was transferred- holdings they could conceivably use to make themselves whole if it were, in fact, fraud.

While I am certainly not desperate, I am greatly annoyed that they would take such a nonsensical approach. 

It leads me to believe either their fraud problem is so bad that they don't care about alienating existing clients or their risk assessment process is completely broken.",m4jfyb6,Fidelity,Same situation as you and when I called they gave me the increase in fraud story as well - but no other financial institution is doing this.

TOS Issues Lately,1iqwxh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkorswim/comments/1iqwxh8/tos_issues_lately/,"As stated in the title, for the last week and a half I've been having some major issues with TOS. I've run the same system for years,  but out of nowhere things seemed to change.  Everything is lagging really bad; charts, level 2, news, Everything! It's honestly to the point I can't actually even trade. I've tried Everything I can think of, I even un-installed the entire system and uploaded the latest version. It's not working! I'm to the point that I'm ready to change brokers as a whole,  but before doing so I wanted to make sure there weren't others experiencing these same types of issues.  Starting around 2 weeks ago was when I started noticing. It's just unfortunate.  Ever since Schwab bought TDA there have been issues with this system. I've given them the benefit of doubt for a while now, but it's frustrating when shit lags so bad that I lose out on a trade. ",md3ois2,thinkorswim,"Did you increase the MEM allocation?

I have no experience with Schwab but the acquisition and move worries me. Pat me on the head and tell me it's a fever dream.",jie2o7k,tdameritrade,"I love ThinnkirSwim so I plan on staying with TDA/Schwab, at least minimally.  Why?  Because I have major issue with IRA core cash sweeps and TDA/Schwab not allowing us to use MMFs as collateral for options trading.  Other brokerages allow you to keep core positions of cash in govt-based money market funds and still use as collateral for options trading.  As an example, Fidelity automatically sweeps to SPAXX for IRA accounts, allowing clients to collect -4.6% interest on uninvested collateral.  With Schwab, anyone who trades options in an IRA only collects 0.35% interest in the standard sweep account.  Schwab makes a lot of money from core sweeps and isn’t sharing it with its clients.

This policy is likely to stay in place for the duration of inverted interest rates, so I may move the majority of my money (7 figures) to Fidelity and keep a minimal amount with TDA just to be able to use ToS for technical analyses.",1,Maidmmm,5,1682912068,2023-05-01 3:34:28,01 May 2023
Housing Prices going to crash due to the recession?,1jry5kk,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1jry5kk/housing_prices_going_to_crash_due_to_the_recession/,Overpriced and inflated for far too long. Discuss.,mlqp8ew,singaporefi,"The new wealth of what we called ‘cash rich’ Singaporeans are built from the continuous recycling of singapore properties. This episode started with the entry of mainland Chinese, some becoming new citizens, who prop up prices of condos, landed properties and coffee shops significantly. Unfortunately, the government did not rein them in and their psf prices have shaped future psf of homes and coffee shops in singapore in the past 5 years. Landed properties have more than doubled, coffee shops have seen record breaking tender and purchase prices in just within 5 years. Many of the mainland Chinese and other foreigners have since left with the ABSD increase.

But Singaporeans are left here and still hoping prices will continue to increase from there. 

With the upcoming economic difficulties, more people will lose jobs, banks will become more strict in giving out loans, and government will become more cautious on market movement probably will introduce more cooling measures to prevent speculative flipping in the current challenging market.

Expect private property prices to dip at least 15-20% from its peak now within 9-12 months once the Trump tariffs start to be felt globally. This will at least bring property affordability to a more realistic level. As to whether it will dip further depends on how severe the global depression goes and for how long. 

Singapore gains from international trade - import and reexport. It also depends heavily on its neighbours and China for food and other essential imports. If these countries are affected, do you think Singapore will be immune from all these ??

Just be prepared for the worst. Best thing to do now is to have sufficient cash for emergencies. Those who over leveraged on properties will unfortunately have to experience the greatest shocks later.",0,Exotic-Excuse-9332,2,1743965369,2025-04-06 18:49:29,06 April 2025

How are you making the transfer and from where? Do you have a USD account with a polish bank and are making a SWIFT wire transfer?

It us usually a fixed amount not a percentage so this method is not great unless you’re transferring thousands of dollars at a time. I get charged about USD 15 for my bank doing it this way. I’m in New Zealand which may be cheaper than Poland.

It is usually cheaper to send the money in your local currency using the local payment system if IB can accept it and then doing a currency trade on IB to get USD.",0,markcnz,2,1713580448,2024-04-20 2:34:08,20 April 2024
My Journey to find a Broker other than Schwab,16vlchf,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/16vlchf/my_journey_to_find_a_broker_other_than_schwab/,"**Forward**: This describes my journey looking for a broker to replace my automated move to Schwab from TDA. These are my thoughts and opinions and I'm not endorsing (as in gaining any monetary benefit) any one broker or service over another.

**The beginning**: I was scheduled to be moved from TDA to Schwab November 3, 2023. I signed up for a Schwab account early and put $50 in it so I could use/try out the trading software.

AT first, I was OK being moved as we were told we would be able to use TOS. While TOS seems to now be available to Schwab users, I find that is just not enough to put up with their otherwise ""horrible software"".

**What I want in a broker**

To be clear about what I was looking for in a broker, I want high option level approval and good software, margin approval, fast trades, and a fricking interface to open into like the TDA start page (Good luck on that!).

Plus, the whole damn thing needs to be usable and not require 20 clicks to find watchlists, option tables (all of them - not just a few dates), my current investments and my net worth, and Hey Schwab! How about some colors - green for up, red for down, we would all really appreciate that! Needless to say, these things and many more features were available on the TDA home page.

**The Brokers I Tried - Not a rundown of all their features, just good and bad points.**

**Schwab** \- One look at their desktop trading and phone app and you start thinking that they cater to 90-year-old buy and hold customers. If they didn't grab TOS from TDA, I don't know how anyone could actually trade options with their software.

**Tasty Trade** \- **Good**: It works OK **Bad**: Didn't like the interface. It's too simple in some ways and too complicated in other ways - esp. the option screen.

**IBKR** \- I tried these guys a few years ago. My impression was they were like desktop TOS - the info is in there if you want to dig it out. I didn't want to dig it out - next.

**Robinhood -** I tried this because some of the TDA guys that were **""let go""** went to work here\*\*. Good\*\* It's simple\*\*. Bad -\*\* It's too simple and too many ads imbedded in the screens. One option lets you put emojis on your trading screen. Hmmmm.

**TradeStation - This is the broker I chose - HOWEVER -- see update below. The reasons:**

1. They actually have customer service you can talk to\*\*.\*\* Schwab was the only other broker you could call and talk to someone in a reasonable amount of wait time.
2. You can trade with them directly in the TradingView app. For some reason I have been using TradingView more and more - esp. since informed that Schwab wanted to annex my account.
3. I have option level 5 with them. They like me and want me to lose my money quicker.
4. Their web software can do everything I need it to do and is very similar to TOS web in function and appearance.
5. A so-so is their desktop app is similar to desktop TOS. It's there if you have the time and want to mess with it.

 **Update October 24, 2023** \- I moved my IRA to TradeStation about 3 weeks ago but I did not move my main trading account as I wanted to see how things worked at TradeStation. It only took 5 work days to transfer my IRA to TradeStation which was good, However, after using their mobile, web, and desktop apps, I am not happy with them. About the only advantage TradeStation really has over Schwab for me is a higher option approval level and that just doesn't make up for their sub-par software.

Currently, my main account will move to Schwab on 3 November. I am staying with Schwab as I can always do my options trades on mobile ToS - which is as good as any other mobile option capable app out there. I have some money at Robinhood and at IBKR, but at this time I don't see them as a destination for my main account.

I didn't realize how difficult it would be to replace TDA and after a month of searching I don't think its possible.

Good luck to all transferees. I hope you find or make a home as good as TDA.",k31f8x5,tdameritrade,"""Plus, the whole damn thing needs to be usable and not require 20 clicks to find watchlists, option tables (all of them - not just a few dates), my current investments and my net worth, and Hey Schwab!

Trading212 Is Helping Short-Selling Hedge Funds & Harming Retail Investors—Enough Is Enough!,1jpkcxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/trading212/comments/1jpkcxh/trading212_is_helping_shortselling_hedge_funds/,"

It’s becoming clearer by the day that Trading212 is actively working against retail investors while helping short-selling hedge funds and market makers. They violate customer rights by manipulating when and how we can buy stocks, ultimately aiding Wall Street thieves in their coordinated efforts to crush retail.

Here’s what they’ve been doing:

1️⃣ They let us buy as many shares as we want— when the price is high. But the moment shorts drive the stock price into the ground? They restrict buying. Right now for e.g. they’re limiting buying to just £60 max on a certain stock that is down 80-90%, making it impossible for us to average down. They have been doing this regularly to highly shorted stocks and helping push them into OTC where they just force sell our shares for peanuts to the greedy wall street short hedge funds.

2️⃣ They use shady terms & conditions as a shield to justify their blatant manipulation. Somehow, when stocks are high, they have no problem letting us buy thousands. But when the price is crushed? Restrictions appear out of nowhere.

3️⃣ Other brokers like IBKR don’t have many of these restrictions. So trading212 is setup in a way specifically to steal from retail. 

4️⃣ They force-sell our shares when companies get pushed into the OTC market, simply because they refuse to let us hold OTC stocks in an ISA account. This means retail is forced to sell at rock-bottom prices, handing our shares over to hedge funds on a silver platter. All these rules have been conveniently setup to make it easier for the wall street thieves to steal from us.

The Coordinated Scam: How Retail Gets Robbed

Step 1: They let retail investors buy at high prices.

Step 2: Hedge funds and market makers short the stock into oblivion.

Step 3: Once the stock is cheap, Trading212 restricts buying, preventing retail from averaging down.

Step 4: With no retail demand, the stock price keeps falling, forcing the company into reverse splits or the OTC market.

Step 5: Trading212 then force-sells our shares when they move to OTC, stealing our money and handing cheap shares to the very hedge funds that shorted them.


This is market manipulation in broad daylight, and regulators need to step in before more retail investors get robbed. We need to raise complaints with financial authorities and demand action.

⚠️ We all need to report these unfair trading restrictions on Trading212! Don’t let them get away with this blatant theft. We deserve a fair market—not one rigged against us.

I am going to raise a complaint with the regulatory authorities about this as all the rules have been stacked up against ordinary retail investors. I would request all of you to do the same as we deserve fairness and assurance that we don't cheated by this highly coordinated scam.
",ml07in0,Trading212,"Where they advertised it as zero fee. They really mean zero upfront fee. But they will take overnight fees every night. Lots of crookey, slimey stuff like that. 

Like the OP said, lots of hidden/disguised stuff in t/c, restricting different trades in different market types, then when you query it, they'll say 'oh we have it written in our legislation we reserve the right to have a 200 pip spread in volatile coniditions' then you look at other brokers rates at the time and their spreads are all normal.

Auto-Exercising Options in Cash Account,1c743su,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibkr/comments/1c743su/autoexercising_options_in_cash_account/,"Hi,

I recently started trading Call and Put options. It's a cash account, so I just buy options with my available cash, no margin play.

So far I have usually traded long term options, like expiring 2025 etc. So I never got to exercise anything. I generally bought long term Call or Put options and when I was in profit, I already sold these contracts. So I guess so far I have only ""traded"" options contracts, that's it. Couple of times I also bought short term options (2-3 weeks) and they expired worthless. Again no chance to exercise.

I have read on IBKR Help that if I never sell my contract until the exercise date, but also don't exercise it myself, it will be auto-exercised if it's in the money. My question is, if I don't have enough cash in the account, how would they ""exercise""? Say it's 1 contract of $50 Call Option for stock X and say it's trading at $60 on exercise day. So it's in the money alright. But I would also need to have $5000 cash to exercise it. So does auto-exercise simply mean, 

- If there is $5000 in the account, they exercise and credit 100 shares in my account

- If there isn't $5000 in the account, they simply put $1000 cash in the account ($60-$50) - as if they exercise but also immediately sell the shares because of lack of funds.

?  
",l09o6zp,ibkr,"Thanks. OK, so if it's ITM, next day I will just see some extra cash in the account as they will close it for me.

Yeah, I mean normally I would definitely take action and close/sell the contract myself before expiration.

So good to know that even they won't be providing you with a service, you won't be totally screwed either.",0,Cagliari77,1,1713513334,2024-04-19 7:55:34,19 April 2024

Last week, my phone was stolen and so I reported to Freetrade some concerns in case anyone logged in and tried to withdraw funds. Fortunately, that didn’t happen, but I was locked out of my account until verification checks took place.

It took 6 days but finally I got the option to carry out these checks. I submitted my driving licence and a selfie, but either there’s a technical issue or I failed (how?!) as the app only gives me an error message about being unable to complete account sign-up. I already have an account though!

The browser gives me the same issue. It’s just showing a message about Freetrade Plus as if I’m signing up to a new account.

It’s like my account has been deleted, along with all my shares!

Edit: I emailed verification@freetrade.io and the automated email suggests these checks take 3-5 working days. I never got an email confirming success/failure, so hopefully what I’m seeing is just a result of my verification pending approval, rather than indicative of any issues.

Why didn't IBKR execute my trade?

Is there actually a trade report?  Or updated positions showing the result of the buy?  If it doesn't look like the order executed and you think the limit should have been hit, then double-check the time in force and flags on the order (I don't know what time zone you're in, but if it's in Eastern or central US/Canada/Americas, the DAY order looks like it was received and submitted during regular trading hours for US exchanges, assuming this happened yesterday).  I assume your account is not restricted from trading this asset because I think IBKR checks this before order submission.

When the reps are already exhausted at 10am,16gqhj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/16gqhj4/when_the_reps_are_already_exhausted_at_10am/,"I realize there are a lot of people who are unhappy with the transition for various reasons (myself included) but I have to hand it to the people (both TDA and Schwab) I've spoken with so far.

A number of them have just sounded exhausted even really early in the day (though not unprofessional) and, when asked, a few noted that yes, they're getting a *metric ton* of blowback and complaints from people who are obviously frustrated.

My own frustration stems from the fact that, essentially, the capabilities and services have been downgraded, i.e. *we're getting less tools in return for parking our money at Schwab*. Trashing account balance history was a pretty big one.

It's obviously not the representatives' fault. I sometimes have trouble remembering this... the front-line folks are on *our side*, and directly feel the pressure not only of questions they can't answer immediately, but also questions for which they know, absolutely, *that the answers are going to make some customers pretty upset*.

Maybe I'll drop some donuts off at my local branch...",k0aeynf,tdameritrade,"Havent heard of that one. Ive tried lots but always went back to Ameritrade.

Would love to know what hidden costs caught you off guard—legal fees, renovations, stamp duties, furnishing, etc.",mn33qxn,singaporefi,"Overall renovation costs including furnishings can easily be 20-30% of the cost of your flat.

People on /r/singapore and /r/singaporefi tend to lean heavily toward just keeping everything barebones and as cheap as possible so the topic of reno costs often gets glossed over, but if you desire a bit more for your home be prepared to set aside a pretty penny.

In particular, the furnishings are a big wildcard especially if you aren't bringing much over from your parents' house. You could go the IKEA route and furnish the whole place for very cheap, but I personally think it's better to put down a little more money on some of the more core furniture items like your dining table and sofa. Doesn't have to be a splurge, but a good sofa could easily run you 3-6k, something to think about.",0,marcuschookt,4,1744648546,2025-04-14 16:35:46,14 April 2025

On the transfer form, it tells me to list the Account Owner Name and Account Title. I'm not sure what to list for the account title. It says on Ameritrade that it typically includes the account owner name and the account type, which might be abbreviated. The only thing I see resembling this is a ""friendly account name"" at the top of my UBS statement. This lists my first name and then RMA (ie Matt RMA).  I don't know if this is what they're talking about or if I'm supposed to just put my full name there again. If anyone can help me out, I would definitely appreciate it.",kc4wsp9,tdameritrade,"Funny enough, UBS didn't know it either.

Adding a co-owner (wife) to my existing account.,11jewjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/11jewjh/adding_a_coowner_wife_to_my_existing_account/,So I’ve had my Ameritrade account for some time now and recently wanted to add my wife to have access to my funds incase I die she can take what’s in there with little trouble. I accidentally made a joint account for us two thinking I was just adding her to my original account so now I have two accounts. One with my balance and the new one with 0. I ended up linking them together. Would she still have access to the funds of my original account if I was to die since she can technically deposit and withdraw to either accounts? Stupid question just want to make sure though. Thanks.,jb2hi6c,tdameritrade,"If you want your wife to gain ownership of everything in your original account when you die, you should make her the primary beneficiary of the account.

If you want to share ownership now, the easiest way is probably to transfer everything from the original brokerage account to the new joint account. You could then close the original account if you like. 

>Would she still have access to the funds of my original account if I was to die 

If you are the sole owner and you die the account will be frozen, I believe. Your beneficiaries would contact TDA with the death certificate to get access to their share. If there were no beneficiaries defined on the account, your executor would be responsible for the dispensation of the account.

TFSA over contributions.

But I called teh CRA today and they said your request is still underprocess with different department and the person can not do anything. All he was suggesting is to Pay the panelty no matter what i say. 

  
I need help from community, I did not feel good after talking to that agent. 

What should I do now? wait for the waiver request decision (For which agent said it can be 180days processing time).  or I should pay the panelties for each year?

Please help, if anyone had been to similar situation. ",ml6ys51,Wealthsimple,"It happened to me when I redeposited too early after withdrawing (as opposed to over directly contributing) between WS TFSA accounts during COVID.
I tried to reverse out of the situation but because funds had gone through a non TFSA account, they had officially left the TFSA. ( I was unable to do a TFSA -> TFSA transfer and was erroneously told that provided all accounts were at the same institution then the CRA should be ok with it.

Stupid error on my part but the CRA were not flexible in the interest payments at all. TFSAs need to be much more user friendly imo.

Most TFSA holders have one account. It’s not hard to calculate the room and present an estimate to the account holder.

Accounts today now have warnings and reminders about the rules because of this very problem. 
In the past there weren’t as many reminders and many people made mistakes unintentionally and have been penalized for it, sometimes wiping out the gains on the savings of using a TFSA in the first place, which is counter to the point of opening the account.

The CRA have been unsuccessfully sued for this very problem and even when the judge sympathized with the plaintiff, their hands were tied due to the legislation around TFSAs. In other countries with similar account types you can’t easily over contribute because the deposit process takes you through the calculation steps and will prevent you over contributing. It’s still possible to mess up but the chances are slim to none.

The result? A whopping $6,800 loss.

TD Ameritrade admitted that they failed to execute my order as requested. But here's the catch - they're claiming that they can't reimburse me for the loss because I only noticed the mistake 12 hours after the condition was met. 

According to their response, ""With the trading that occurred, as well as the time that passed, this could be construed as a free look, and we would not be able to compensate you for this trade.""

If I had immediately noticed it and contacted them, the damage would still have been $6,800. The market didn’t dramatically change over those hours. I didn’t notice their system failure. I don't think anyone expects TD Ameritrade's systems to fail when placing conditional orders.

Has anyone had any experience with this situation? Experience in arbitration against TD Ameritrade with FINRA, NFA, or AAA to get their money back?

As far as ""banks,"" in your example, if you are using a bank's app, and the app failed due to their error, for example, you deposited a check electronically, but it failed to deposit, then they would likely also treat this the same way, in other words, they would look at the situation and make a judgment in favor of the customer or in favor of the bank.

PSA: Morgan Stanley Checking $250 bonus bait and switch with dishonest customer service,1juz28b,https://www.reddit.com/r/etrade/comments/1juz28b/psa_morgan_stanley_checking_250_bonus_bait_and/,"Here is what was stated in their terms:

Here is how to get your $250 cash bonus:
Set up direct deposit, each of $1,000 or more. Learn how at etrade.com/directdeposit.
Ensure you receive two qualifying direct deposits within the next 90 days.
Get rewarded with a $250 bonus deposit into your new account. Pretty nice, eh?

What I did:

1. Opened checking account in December 2024
2. Set up direct deposit from my employer at $1000 each
3. After 1 direct deposit, get an email from E-trade with the subject ""You're on track to receive a cash bonus in your new account""
4. Got 2 direct deposits in a row, then immediately withdrew the $2000 that was deposited and stopped depositing to the checking account
5. April 2025: receive a message with the subject ""About your recent enrollment in our cash bonus"" - says ""You recently opened a new checking account from Morgan Stanley Private Bank, Member FDIC as part of a cash bonus offer. Unfortunately, your account did not meet the offer requirements to qualify for the cash bonus."" then lists the offer terms (which of course do not mention any restrictions on withdrawing money).
6. Call customer service and ask specifically why my bonus was denied - rep doesn't know, puts me on hold to talk to his manager, then says it's because I withdrew the money and that withdrawing the money was not allowed under the terms. I would have been less annoyed if he just told me I was denied ""because they can"" (since there is a ""We reserve the right... to rescind or decline award payment"" clause) but instead he lied and said the terms had specifically disallowed withdrawal.

Several other reports of this happening in the comments on the Doctor of Credit site under the article ""[Targeted] E*Trade $300 Checking Bonus"" (do not want to post a link in case that's automoderator filtered).

TDA charges $25 for outgoing transfers (both domestic and international), while the moomoo fees you quoted above are a little less.

FHSA Tax Filing,1jgtiar,https://i.redd.it/nzcld57pd4qe1.jpeg,"Hi Reddit, 
I’m filing my taxes and am a little lost on this portion: 

I opened the account in October 2024 and contributed less than the maximum a year (8k I believe?) where can I find these information? I don’t see it on my T4FHSA. Is it in my CRA account?

New fidelity brokerage,1gto6pf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1gto6pf/new_fidelity_brokerage/,"Here’s my experience with opening a fidelity brokerage.

Last week I opened one up and put $100 into it. It went pretty smooth, and I downloaded the app and planned to transfer more money to it later that week.

Two days after opening it, I get a notice that my account has been restricted/locked, because I need to provide some sort of document.

I had to call customer service to figure out what was going on and they said I need to show proof of my physical address with a copy of my mortgage statement, rent statement, or utility bills.

I explain to the person that my living situation is unique and I do not have a mortgage or rent and I’m not the one paying utility bills so I cannot provide what they are asking for.

This went back-and-forth with multiple people for a couple days. Lots of time wasted. In the end, they said I would not be able to use their brokerage services unless I provided one of those three documents that I literally cannot provide for them.

I asked them to give me my money back and close the account.

They said they were going to hold the money for a month before giving me my money back.

Their reasoning for this overreach is trash.

If they want these documents then it should be part of the initial account creation and not days later after you load up money and they hold it hostage.

Completely untrue. It's not in a broker's interest to keep only losing accounts. The losers eventually go broke and no longer generate any revenue for the broker. Brokers want successful clients who grow their accounts, trade more frequently and generate ever increasing commissions and margin interest.

>The moment total withdrawal amount gets somewhere close to total deposit amount ""Fraud investigation"" starts and the account closes with money gone forever.

No. Brokers monitor for illegal activity like money laundering. There are posts here occasionally about accounts being locked for fraud investigation. We don't know the details, but it's possible they deposited money and tried to withdraw it before it cleared or had several rejected deposits.

"$50,000 stolen out of my 401k account and Fidelity refuses to investigate. 20yr customer.",1ie0crr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1ie0crr/50000_stolen_out_of_my_401k_account_and_fidelity/,"I discovered that I reported about $40,000 less income—approximately 15% of my total income for that year—on a tax return from two years ago after receiving a notice from the IRS. This discrepancy occurred because someone fraudulently took out a 401(k) loan in my name without my knowledge. They mailed a paper check, which was cashed by an unknown person. The loan defaulted after I switched jobs, causing the automatic payroll deductions to stop. Unfortunately, I didn’t closely check my pay stubs during my final months at the company and missed those deductions of $100 to $200 for loan repayments.

Fast forward ten months since I uncovered this situation, and I have been trying to work with Fidelity to resolve it. Almost a year has passed, and they JUST NOW saying they won’t investigate further because the check is too old. The entire process has been filled with nonstop delays. I’ve repeatedly asked for copies of the endorsed check and even had to fill out a notarized affidavit stating that the signature was not mine and that I did not receive the money. Despite contacting them more than a dozen times, I still have no clear answers on how this will be resolved. Eventually, I received news that their investigation team deemed the check too old to take any action. Now, there is $50,000 missing, and I haven't heard anything from their investigation team, even though I’ve been a Fidelity customer for 15 years and have invested millions with them.

I reviewed Fidelity's customer protection guarantee, and it seems like it should cover situations like this involving my 401(k) and retirement account. It feels like there has been a serious breach of contract here, and I honestly don’t know what to do next.

This experience certainly motivated me to raise financially savvy kids but all they seem to be interested in when it comes to money management is crypto trading and grabbing sign up bonuses everywhere like  [$75](https://www.gemini.com/share/7llnqkyhp), which is their latest favorite from Gemini

Firstly, in my opinion I would argue investing in virgin Galactic is more risky than Lloyds and not really sure why you think Lloyds is risky anyway. 

To be pedantic, I don't think you can call a LISA and investment. It's a savings account with some perks. 

Investing in the stock market can increase your capital but not necessarily your income. Sure the money is coming to you so it's income in a sense but not consistent reliable money which is what a mortgage broker cares about. 

As for the index stocks it sounds like for you that's the way to go. They're safer yes and they bring decent returns for long term investments.

Hey everyone,

We’re Thomas and Dominik, two colleagues working together in a web development team. Like many of you, we’ve been super frustrated trying to prepare accurate German tax reports from Interactive Brokers (IBKR). If you’ve ever tried to use IBKR’s reports for your German tax return, you probably know the pain: incorrect forex conversions, mixed capital gains from stocks and options, and reports that just don’t match what the German tax office expects.

Instead of complaining, we decided to do something about it. Over the past few weeks, we’ve developed an early version of a tool called BubbleTax.de. It can import your IBKR reports and generate reports that are accurate and easy to understand. Here’s what BubbleTax does:

* Correctly calculates forex conversions according to the German FIFO standard.
* Clearly separates capital gains from stocks and options.
* Generates reports compatible with German tax expectations (ex. USD to EUR conversion for the right dates).

We now need your help! The tool is free to use (in beta), and we’re actively looking for feedback to improve it further. We’re developers, not accountants, so your real-world data and edge cases will help us grow BubbleTax into a genuinely helpful resource for everyone struggling with IBKR and German taxes.

No catch, no guarantees — just two developers trying to solve a problem and share it with the community.

Feel free to test it now at [bubbletax.de](http://bubbletax.de), and please let us know your feedback or questions in the comments below!

Thanks a ton,

Thomas & Dominik  
\---

**TL;DR**: We’re web developers who built a free beta tool (bubbletax.de) to solve IBKR reporting issues for German taxes, and we need your feedback to make it even better!

**Update - IMPORTANT**: This beta version only works with IBKR CSV exports in **German**. More information can be found in the export guide. Otherwise you get errors like `['Vermögenswertkategorie'] not found in axis`",mhq4s2r,InteractiveBrokers,"Gute Zusammenfassung zu Optionen von u/blibb14 👍

1. Get a detailed report and data on the major hospitalization and post-hospitalization cost claims by IP and IP riders, and break down if additional tests and scans actually improve the recovery of patients. Just because IP riders claim more than non IP riders does not mean increased cost does not help in medical case recovery. It may be that there is no choice but to go to private, which has high costs, to save a life in urgency. Without such data insight it is not possible to dismiss private health care as wasteful.
2. increase the premiums/riders/basic MediSave for people who have chosen detrimental habits like smoking, vaping, and drugs. Excludes sugar. sodium or fat intake,

increase the premiums of people who have committed crimes like scamming and white-collar crimes involving a certain threshold amount. Canning is introduced for scamming. why not increase the premiums? China has more draconian  blacklist excluding high speed transport and other privileges

Question I have is, which one is better and kills enemies quicker when kiting solo? Thanks!",mikvonb,vanguard,"I'm scratching my head here. Kiting usually takes longer to kill mobs than killing them in melee and only is necessary because the class is too squishy.

In my head that means the need to kite equals slower leveling, not fast leveling. But maybe I was doing it wrong... Never liked kiting.

My endgame class was monk and my first lvl 50 was a bloodmage. Bloodmage was really nice, underwater breathing, invisibility, I was able to sneak through almost everything. Combat? Head on heal-tanking, no problem.

Closed code - how does one create closed code to share with others?,1egx7zf,https://www.reddit.com/r/tradestation/comments/1egx7zf/closed_code_how_does_one_create_closed_code_to/,"Hi, I see some vendors that offer Closed Code access to their strategies. But how does one create closed code to share with others? I couldnt find anything in the docs. Thanks  
",lhi9tuo,TradeStation,"I’ve never done this but since no one has responded I asked ChatGPT:

—-

Creating closed code, or proprietary code, for TradeStation strategies involves developing strategies in TradeStation's proprietary languages, such as EasyLanguage, and then compiling the code in a way that protects it from being accessed or copied by others. TradeStation allows strategy developers to share their work without revealing the underlying code through the use of protected or encrypted files.

Here’s how you can typically go about creating and distributing closed code strategies in TradeStation:

1. **Develop Your Strategy**: Use EasyLanguage to create your trading strategy, which is TradeStation's programming language designed for trading strategies and indicators.

2. **Protect Your Code**: TradeStation offers a feature to protect your EasyLanguage code. When you are ready to distribute your strategy, you can use the `Protect` function within the TradeStation development environment to encrypt your code. This makes the code unreadable to others, hence preserving your intellectual property.

3. **Compile and Export**: After protecting your strategy, compile it into an executable form (.ELD file) that can be used in TradeStation but cannot be reverse-engineered easily. This file can be distributed to others who can use the strategy within their TradeStation platform without accessing the source code.

4. **Documentation and Support**: Since users won’t be able to view or modify the code, provide detailed documentation about how the strategy works and what inputs or parameters can be adjusted. Offering good support can also be crucial for closed code strategies.

5. **Distribute Your Strategy**: You can distribute your compiled and protected files directly to your customers or through TradeStation's Strategy Network, where users can browse and purchase strategies.

If these options aren't visible or available in your version of TradeStation, or if the process has changed, contacting TradeStation support directly would be the best way to get precise and updated instructions tailored to the current software version and features.",0,trayber,2,1723330456,2024-08-10 22:54:16,10 August 2024

Many thanks!",lodu1m4,ibkr,"The box usually isn't too risky, so the margin should be low.

Margin brokers mostly don't care if you run out of cash, because they will readily lend it.  But why?  Because, if needed, they'll liquidate your positions until they get comfortable -- so it's not a ""cash"" question, it's a ""risk"" question.  And risk is essentially the amount of potential account variability (losses, mainly) versus account value.

And because the box isn't usually highly variable in value (relative to notional amount), that explains the low-risk/low-margin treatment.

If you sell a box and don't have the cash at expiration but your account value/risk is still fine, then the only thing you'd expect from them is to start tracking the interest you owe them (instead of to the options box market maker) -- because risk is what they really care about, not a negative cash balance.

How can it go wrong?

- If there's massive rate volatility or financial system problems, they might spike the margin requirement, causing a need for liquidation to resolve the margin level

- If the account value falls too much (eg, from a withdrawal or because the risk assets -- possibly bought with box proceeds -- lost too much value, etc)",0,OurNewestMember,2,1727022773,2024-09-22 16:32:53,22 September 2024

If I am under 25k on PDT acc then no more day trades or can I still get 3 day trades per 5 trading days?!,14ye0gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/14ye0gf/if_i_am_under_25k_on_pdt_acc_then_no_more_day/,"Say my TD acc drops below 25k and I am PDT and I see this beatufil message that I am in a margin call and it says 

 A **day-trade minimum equity call** is in effect because your account has been identified as a pattern day trading account with less than $25,000 in total account value. You can meet this call by increasing your total account value to $25,000 by the start of a trading day. If you complete a day trade while in a day-trade equity call, this account will be restricted to closing transactions until the account value is above $25,000 by the start of a trading day. 

Now I never use margin, so I only use funds available for trading aka my money aka I never borrow so I don't think I gotta worry about them liquidating my positions to cover margin call since I'm not on margin but this warning is telling me I can't day trade no more unless I go above 25k. Now here is the question, suppose I stay below 25k, this means I can't buy positions any more? So basically 22k is useless or I am still able to day trade like 3 times per 5 trading days? Thanks yall",luste46,tdameritrade,"The 25k doesn't have to be liquid it counts all shares of all stocks towards your brokerage account value. However if you don't use margin switch to a cash account only and you can do unlimited day trades and never get marked as a pattern day trader. PDT is meant for flag people buying and selling on margin aka credit, that want to day trade like a cash account and typically they don't even use them to make much almost like penny stock traders/  $1 an option at most. If you day trade and don't have 25k you shouldn't be using margin account anyways till you learn more. ",0,Simple-Hedgehog-3359,1,1730428827,2024-11-01 2:40:27,01 November 2024

Specific questions regarding SPX order fills,1jx4zt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkorswim/comments/1jx4zt1/specific_questions_regarding_spx_order_fills/,"I know this is a common question but the answers are always vague.  

I’m paper trading SPX options. Market orders, always single qty.  i know, paper trades gives favorable fills. I get that. Although typically even in paper trading I’ll get market buy orders filled at the ask, market sell order at the bid. 

But for Live trading, specifically 0DTE options, usually ATM:

Do single qty orders reliably fill quickly enough where a market order will be within the bid/ask spread? By quickly enough I mean a few seconds at most. That assumes the bid/ask spread doesn’t update just before the order is filled. Or can it fill outside the  spread?  I’m good with paying the ask price and selling at the bid price for what I’m doing. I’m not new to options, I just have always used limit/stop orders but those didn’t require asap fill times. 

I’ve been finding that trying to set Limit / Stop thresholds takes too long both to input and execute.  I am ok with market orders filling on either end of the spread because the change in option price is enough to more than make up for that (assuming <80% IV, earlier in the day, high delta, and of course the point change goes in the right direction…). Basically, this is assuming the spread is like $0.40.

I just want to make sure I’m not going to run the risk of a simple single quantity market order taking considerably longer to fill than it does in paper trading - and sometimes there they take a few seconds or maybe 10 to fill but I try to cancel them if it is taking long.

And if you don’t have actual experience with what I’m asking then please don’t answer.  That just causes confusion.",mmod4pg,thinkorswim,"Yeah I know, figured I’d at least try to keep the bs to a minimum.  

And thanks, that is what I figured as well about the liquidity. I just read so many comments where people say you’ll get screwed with Market orders but that doesn’t help at all when the specifics of the order aren’t provided.  Sure, wide spreads Market orders is a terrible idea.

My current strategy has been so simple and lucrative in paper trading that I’m trying to figure out what I’m missing since everyone isn’t doing this.  Even if paper trading is giving me better fills that would only account for maybe 20% of my profits, assuming the fill is the ask price at most.   Even in paper trading I’ll get screwed sometimes because the price will fluctuate before my order fills and i’ll be down but it bounces back quickly or I just cut my losses.   

IV makes a huge difference.  Trading SPX after noon-ish things start getting dangerous.  But 9:30-11:30 it is so easy to make a quick $500 by just catching a nice little trend change.  Get in, get out.  Don’t be greedy, don’t push it.  I’ll often miss out on another $500 by selling too early but, hell, making a quick $300-500, sometimes more with single trades like 10 times a day, even if you take a hit on a couple it is still easy enough to make some real money.  In using $50k-$100k in capital I average like $2500 a day.  2 weeks I’ve made $30k.  That is no yolo stuff, playing as if it was real money.  Seems too good to be true but even if I can make half of that with live trading I’m pretty happy.  

I want to cash out my 401k to do this but I don’t want to take the tax and early withdrawal penalty only to find that the live trading experience with these quick market orders is way different.",0,Ochopuss,1,1744427840,2025-04-12 3:17:20,12 April 2025

Anyone here uses Heiken Ashi candles?,1jyx3g1,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkorswim/comments/1jyx3g1/anyone_here_uses_heiken_ashi_candles/,"Anyone here using Heiken Ashi candles regularly? Let’s talk…

I’ve been incorporating Heiken Ashi into my chart setup and I gotta say — the clarity it adds to trends is pretty wild.

Here’s why I like them:

They smooth out noise, especially on the 5-min and 15-min charts.

Easier to stay in a winning trade (less tempted to exit on a random red candle).

Helps me visually filter chop vs clean trend.

Great when paired with indicators like Parabolic SAR, TMO, and EMA stacks.


That said… They do lag a bit. So I keep regular candles on another chart to confirm wicks, entries, and reversals. It’s like having a clean visual overlay for momentum, not a replacement.

Curious — how do YOU use Heiken Ashi?

Do you use it for entries or just confirmation?

Any combos that work best for you?

Might be worth mentioning to the new people looking to open a SIPP that the Goverment ( HMRC if UK ) will contribute 25% of what you add/contribute to your SIPP.  takes something like 6 weeks but they just add it to your account.

On the other Hand it is also worth checking if theres anything in the PLUS section you actually want - could save a bit there too.  Personally I dont find PLUS that attractive especially for a SIPP , but thats my preference.

Hey everyone,

We’re Thomas and Dominik, two colleagues working together in a web development team. Like many of you, we’ve been super frustrated trying to prepare accurate German tax reports from Interactive Brokers (IBKR). If you’ve ever tried to use IBKR’s reports for your German tax return, you probably know the pain: incorrect forex conversions, mixed capital gains from stocks and options, and reports that just don’t match what the German tax office expects.

Instead of complaining, we decided to do something about it. Over the past few weeks, we’ve developed an early version of a tool called BubbleTax.de. It can import your IBKR reports and generate reports that are accurate and easy to understand. Here’s what BubbleTax does:

* Correctly calculates forex conversions according to the German FIFO standard.
* Clearly separates capital gains from stocks and options.
* Generates reports compatible with German tax expectations (ex. USD to EUR conversion for the right dates).

We now need your help! The tool is free to use (in beta), and we’re actively looking for feedback to improve it further. We’re developers, not accountants, so your real-world data and edge cases will help us grow BubbleTax into a genuinely helpful resource for everyone struggling with IBKR and German taxes.

No catch, no guarantees — just two developers trying to solve a problem and share it with the community.

Feel free to test it now at [bubbletax.de](http://bubbletax.de), and please let us know your feedback or questions in the comments below!

Thanks a ton,

Thomas & Dominik  
\---

**TL;DR**: We’re web developers who built a free beta tool (bubbletax.de) to solve IBKR reporting issues for German taxes, and we need your feedback to make it even better!

**Update - IMPORTANT**: This beta version only works with IBKR CSV exports in **German**. More information can be found in the export guide. Otherwise you get errors like `['Vermögenswertkategorie'] not found in axis`",mhw0qyi,InteractiveBrokers,"As IBKR somehow doesn’t give me a German tax report (even after having enabled the option over a year ago), I’ll definitely give this a try in the next few days!

Webulls new March cash bonus- is there a catch?,1j9vb6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Webull/comments/1j9vb6a/webulls_new_march_cash_bonus_is_there_a_catch/,"I'm guessing I received the promo emails because I qualify. Seems like a solid deal. But is there a catch?

Many folks just withdrew thousands after the latest 180 day APY booster promo ended. Can I redeposit money I just sent out of Webull last month?

Doing some quick math, if this new $25,001 deposit qualifies for the 3.75% cash management amount(I don't see why they wouldn't continue this), this new $750 bonus amounts to an overall 6.75% gain. 

The math. 3.75% of $25,001 is roughly $937. Add in the $750 as an overall yearly bonus, and we get $1687. $1687 is exactly 6.75%

At the lowest $5,000 level, you're looking at just a 5.75% overall 'boosted' apy for the duration of the promo. 

I guess these are questions for their chat. Just thought I'd get some opinions. Other than not being able to move your money for a year, 6.75% seems unmatched. 

The promo was emailed and within their promo page as of noon today. ",miuzb6w,webull,"If I put in $5000, and the associated bonus is $100, is that $100 a month? or $100 total. 2% return is pretty terrible with current CD rates. But $100 a month seems too good to be true...

  
Edit: Okay I get it, 3.75% with their cash management, and then another 2% in bonus cash so 5.75% annual returns on the 5k, which is actually better than any CD I could find",0,VarrenKasul,1,1742503280,2025-03-20 20:41:20,20 March 2025

"Fidelity, What's Happening? Customers Deserve Answers",1g82ty4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1g82ty4/fidelity_whats_happening_customers_deserve_answers/,"
Has anyone else noticed the growing issues at Fidelity lately? We're seeing major changes with no communication from Fidelity about what's going on, why it’s happening, or how long these issues will last.

Here’s a few complaints of what’s happening:

Deposits have been frozen for weeks

Automated payments have been canceled

Debit cards delayed indefinitely 


These disruptions are catching people off guard, and Fidelity hasn’t given any heads-up. The only way to find out what’s wrong is by contacting customer service, where you learn that your funds are blocked or that you've been hit with fines for missed payment againm, with no warning.

The reason given? Some vague explanation about increased fraudulent activity. But there’s no clear information about which services are affected or any timeline for when things will be resolved. Even worse, customer service reps can’t provide any details or connect you to anyone higher up who has more answers. We shouldn't be reading about policy  changes being made at Fidelity due to fraud on some online news article. If I wire money to my brokerage account and it states available same day, I expect that to be the case. If they change is to 21 days before it's settled, that should be stated at the time of transaction. That is the bare minimum. Customers should be currently informed before making important fiscal decisions that can cause severe issues  otherwise. This shouldn't even need to be said and the fact that it is raises some serious red flags and questions as to how Fidelity is handling customers  assests.


The online support isn’t any better. Customers are being directed to an outdated FAQ that doesn’t reflect the current issues. It almost like Fidelity is deliberately keeping us in the dark, and it’s starting to feel like there’s more going on than just fraud prevention.

What’s most concerning is the silence from Fidelity's leadership. People are being financially impacted, and it's through no fault of their own. Fidelity, what’s really going on? Can we still trust you with our money, or should we start looking for alternatives?

Is anyone else dealing with these problems? Would love to hear your experiences.
",lt4i0su,Fidelity,"If you call, you will at least get a straight answer. 

I called on 10-OCT-2024 and the rep explained that any electronic deposits (literally anything than mailing or hand delivering a paper check to cash) now has a clearance time of up to 16 business days (vs 1-5 before). Likewise, debit cards stopped going out early September.

The rep sounded genuinely sympathetic to the problem, which was appreciated. I knew he had no control over it and couldn't have gotten an answer to when these policies will revert no matter how hard he tried.

Now for personal conjecture part - they are trying to do as much sweeping under the rug as possible. Just like with Chase - it was a flaw in **their** system that allowed bogus checks to be cashed. So while they aren't to blame for people committing credit card fraud, they still aren't bothering to take any corrective and preventative actions. 

I'm guessing that means whoever built their software was a 3rd party contractor and not in-house staff. So the delay is going to be for them to go through the super long and super bureaucratic process of finding a contractor who is the lowest bidder but still able to do a better job than the last one :-/",-1,arrayftn,3,1729571274,2024-10-22 4:27:54,22 October 2024

PSA: Schwab Transition Details,147weyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/147weyy/psa_schwab_transition_details/,"Seeing quite a few posts with a lot of misinformation and questions about the Schwab transition, so I called and spoke to my TDA/Schwab rep.  Below are details of that conversation.

1- **The Think or Swim (ToS) platform, including desktop, web version and mobile apps are not being discontinued or going away.**

2- The transition of accounts from TDA to Schwab have started with those that are not using ToS moving first.  Traders who use ToS with lower volumes will move next, and then those who have higher volumes to trades will move last.  All accounts will be transitioned over weekends ~~with the goal is to complete everyone by about October 2023~~ *(Edit: Please see the posts below indicating that Oct. 23 is highly unlikely for completion and the transition may go into 2024)*.  When this happens we'll need to set up a new Schwab ID and PW.

***Edit: Updated information is that the transition is going slower than expected so completion dates are TBD.***

3- The ToS platform is being kept as it was an important part of why they bought TDA.  Schwab is not only keeping ToS, but is investing to improve it.  The rep told me that he thinks we'll all like the improvements they are working on.

4- New users signing up now will get a Schwab account which will not have access to ToS right away.  These new traders are being told ToS will be available ""later in 2023"".

See this Schwab page for transition details:  [https://welcome.schwab.com/?cmp=ilc-WKV](https://welcome.schwab.com/?cmp=ilc-WKV)

An additional note is that we will all log into a Schwab account once transitioned as the TDA accounts will no longer exist.",jny8hqy,tdameritrade,"What about those of us who used the TDA app before (not ToS), but now after having been forced to used the absolute dumpster fire that is the Schwab app, now would like to use ToS? 

Can we move over now? Or do we have to wait?0",,Mint_Wilderness,4,1686620283,2023-06-13 1:38:03,13 June 2023

I am buying MSTY stock and letting it ride on dividends. I am looking to go back to IB because of its low fees but I have not used IB for a long time.

I am in US. I opened an account on moomoo to take advantage of their promotions on Nov 22.

I did a wire transfer Nov 22 night time.

As of Dec 2, there is still no credit to my account yet. I have made 5 phone calls and sent 6 e-mails in the meantime. I did note in the wire transfer my moomoo id where to deposit my money to.

Each time, the customer service tells me they could only get the funding team to credit the account. He can't do anything else.

On Dec 2, I told them to close my account and refund me money.

Their ACH is very slow too. Takes more than 3 days to receive money.",m06f68p,moomoo_official,"Your situation sounds very specific to the US side. IBKR should be good for you but I am based in the southern hemisphere so they're not as good for me for the lag. Their platform TWS does have a pretty steep learning curve though once you get used to it they're excellent. I would have stayed with them if not for their lag and their customer service who copy and paste from a template regardless of your issue so that's to be warned. Payment wise they're pretty good they will give you a date straight up when you should expect it in your account but it's normally 2-3 business days and they have a much stringent fraud prevention and security measures so you'd probably have your funds held a bit longer than you expect for a standard procedure so that's a heads up for you but overall they are an excellent platform that tells you what to expect.

Not sure about Fidelity. I can't open an account with them on the southern hemisphere.

Moomoo released my funds rather quickly after I emailed them, probably partly because I am based in the southern hemisphere where they have a separate office. I can't say for sure but I do have to give credits where credits due since I got mine resolved although the customer service experience was far from pleasant. I can only say I hold a higher bar because I came from customer service background myself and they need a lot of work on that front.",-1,Old_Addendum_4592,3,1733219143,2024-12-03 9:45:43,03 December 2024

The other half which were VUAG show on the app as ""Transfer failed, we have sent you an email with more information"". I have no such email. Vanguard mentions that all shares have transferred out successfully. But half my portfolio is missing and all I am getting with Trading 212 is the generic ""we are very busy"" and ""you will hear from a transfer specialist in 48 hours"". It's been 10 days; no one has contacted me, and I keep getting generic responses on the app. Literally thousands of pounds are missing. This isn't a good way to start a new financial relationship.

I feel literally ghosted by Trading 212 when literally half my portfolio is missing, not pending or just taking a long time to come over, the funds are literally nowhere.

"40 days till transition, it's decision time.",1bsdmln,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/1bsdmln/40_days_till_transition_its_decision_time/,"I don't think I can live with the schwab platform for my daily active trading. Seeking opinions on where to go.

Years of experience by platform.

TD Ameritrade: 10+

e\*Trade: 5+

Schwab: \~3

Interactive Brokers: < 1

I really don't understand why Schwab is moving TD to the Schwab platform when the TD platform is so superior but the piece that I just can't get over is why Schwab didn't take the hover pop-up and move it over when they brought over ToS. That hover popup is so useful on decision making without going off platform. I do all of my screening and analytics with google finance and finviz so I don't need a replacement for that but I do need a data rich holdings platform.

I much prefer the e\*Trade holdings grid to the schwab so I would go there except the lack of the hover pop-up and really bad click through page is close to useless.

With the TD web platform I have everything I desire with the left side with the holdings and hover pop-up and the right side dock customized with all the broader info (news, markets, watchlists). As far as I can tell, no other of the big platforms allow any customizations beyond columns and column order. No widgets, or dock like info, no hover pop-ups with relevant next level stock info.

I like e\*Trade's options screen better than TD's popup but there doesn't seem to be anything better about Schwab on any matters of importance. 

I haven't found anything I like about IBKR.  It seems style over substance.

With 40 days left, I can't believe I'm stuck with Schwab abandoning the 9/10 platform and migrating clients to the simpleton app that works best for buy and hold investing.

Has anyone found anything customizable and even 50% as comprehensive as the TD web app?

Merrill Edge agent called to ask my total exact number liquid asset (including my 401k and others) for self invested account then hanged up on me saying I am being aggressive.,1egqoyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/MerrillEdge/comments/1egqoyr/merrill_edge_agent_called_to_ask_my_total_exact/,"I had been trying to open up an investment account with Merrill for three weeks, they always ask for this and that and not closing the loop. Today one agent called (without verification text/providing her name) for my total liquid asset. I originally gave them the amount online and they were asking for total investable amount so I took it as my total investable amount with Merrill. Then the agent said this amount does not match my house value that they think i have money elsewhere (I do not remember providing my house' estimated value). I question why do they need the information especially my other account information like 401K, other investment account in other firms, and why it is a problem that my investable amount is smaller than my house value. The customer service cannot answer the question but just repeat her original question. I understand there's KYC, but when a customer is not comfortable providing the information, instead of explain it in a way that customer would understand and accept, she said i am talking over her (because she is literally repeating the same question over and over), and i am loud, and she is going to cut me off. Then I ask for her manager, she said she is comfortable to patch it to her manager, I asked when, then she hangs up. Ridiculous customer service and I closed out my Merrill account, I can do much better place in Fidelity. Anything/anywhere I can escalate this to? Yelp?",lg5e7yf,merrilledge,""" The type of information required of a broker is spelled out in Rule 17a-3(a)(17) of the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seact1934.asp).

The rule specifically requires the customer's name, SSN/TIN, mailing address, telephone number, date of birth, employment status (including occupation and whether the customer is an [associated person](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/associatedperson.asp) of an exchange, a broker, or a [dealer](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dealer.asp)), annual income, net worth (excluding the value of a primary residence), and investment objectives.

Tax compliance is one reason that brokers need personal information. Investors need to report capital gains, losses, and dividends to the IRS. And brokers must have this data in order to send the required forms each year.

The SEC lists three other reasons why brokers are required to ask for personal information. They are [suitability](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/suitable.asp), record-keeping requirements, and anti-terrorist/[anti-money laundering (AML)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aml.asp) laws. ""

- from Investopedia

I think because Merrill has advisory services, their questions regarding suitability would be wider than say a RobinHood because they need to gauge what other services to offer to you.

That information is also used so they know how to negotiate terms with you.   I was offered $\_\_\_,  \_\_% margin rate, \_\_ fees waivers etc. to move my accounts over.  I decided not to do it, but used their terms to negotiate better terms at my broker.  If you're just trying to open a generic basic account, I don't know why they're asking for value of your home,",0,PseudoTsunami,1,1722610713,2024-08-02 14:58:33,02 August 2024
New UK investor,1jyb3sl,https://www.reddit.com/r/trading212/comments/1jyb3sl/new_uk_investor/,"If you don't mind answering a new person's queries I'm very new but would appreciate the input.

You can go to Invesco's website, (or any ETF / fund for that matter) like Vanguard, iShares, whatever -- And you can see the EXACT holdings, the precise weighting, you can see the fees, the Geography they cover, the exchanges they are sold at, what the tickers are.   You can also see all the different funds they offer. You can do more research, beyond looking at the funds on T212.  

Expand your scope a bit, and remember to not rush into anything.  Stocks can be risky.  But equip yourself with some more knowledge.

Good Bye Merrill Edge,1jpvwgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MerrillEdge/comments/1jpvwgd/good_bye_merrill_edge/,"Recently opened an account and moved assets over to take advantage of preferred rewards. And boy was that a mistake the platform and service is horrendous. Just light years behind other investment firms I was truly shocked. I am closing my account. Here were some of my pain points:

-transfer funds button did not work at all on mobile app 

-Worked on the website but I could not link my bank account digitally so I had to submit a manual form 

-The form process is supposed to take 48 hrs but didn’t hear anything for 4 days. I called and rep said everything looked fine and to check in another 24 hrs

-24 hrs later nothing…..I called back and rep now says back office doesn’t see a form uploaded try again

-I upload again, I get a confirmation this time but then receive a call from back office that my request can’t be processed for another 10 days because my bank account can’t be linked until my account is 30 days old

-notice my dividends weren’t reinvested. Go to see if I can switch dividend setting find out I need to submit another MANUAL form 

-go to manually reinvest my dividend and find out they charge a $20 transaction fee on my simple vanguard S&P fund????

Good bye Edge, absolute pitiful experience. ",ml3nqbh,merrilledge,"Merrill automatic investment plans do not take fees when buying vanguard funds. Maybe for the first one they do? But I’ve had mine going for 2 years now going biweekly and don’t pay the $20 fee. Same for dividend reinvestment. Merrill’s platform isn’t the best, but it is worth it to max out the preferred rewards and then keep the rest of your money elsewhere.",1,sweendiggity,2,1743631819,2025-04-02 22:10:19,02 April 2025
"Can I get box spread loans with margin accounts, or only possible with portfolio margin?",1juh1nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibkr/comments/1juh1nd/can_i_get_box_spread_loans_with_margin_accounts/,"I applied for a margin account, since my NV is not 110k yet, can I still get box spread loans? Or my only option with margin accounts is the margin loan from IBKR?",mm3tauc,ibkr,"I think people still sell boxes on reg-T, but the cash proceeds are offset by a corresponding increase in margin requirement.

So, I think the typical use case is like when you deposit 50k USD, buy 80k marginable stocks and then to reduce your cost on the 30k (eg, from offered 6.8% margin rate down to maybe market +30bps, so maybe to around 4.6%), then you'd sell enough box to cover the 30k cash and leaving your remaining margin about the same (and getting your cash close to zero, but not too high or too low).

Another alternative is to not buy 80k of stocks but to buy 80k worth of stock as synthetic long options spreads or similar leverage.  Eg, if a stock is trading at 100/sh spot, then I could buy 8 synthetic long spreads around the 40 strike, using up my 50k on 80k worth of stock exposure.  I don't know the details of how the margining works compared to stocks on reg-T, though.  This can achieve the stock exposure and leverage in one transaction.  But there can be other issues involved like taxes.

Some potential limitations to call out are the exercise style of the options -- I don't think an American style box will margin the same as European style (although people don't usually want the early assignment anyway).  Also I think selling a securities box in a retirement account is doable, but I'm not sure what limitations might exist.

But anyway, selling a box without portfolio margin should work at least in several cases, especially to get funding cheaper than broker margin loans.",0,OurNewestMember,2,1744147507,2025-04-08 21:25:07,08 April 2025
Fid closed all my accounts during hurricane Helene and refuses to give reason,1g3whb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1g3whb9/fid_closed_all_my_accounts_during_hurricane/,"TL;DR: I'm a hurricane Helene victim and while I've had no power for 14 days, Fidelity closed all of my accounts, including retirement accounts, without notifying me in any way or giving me any reason or recourse. You've been warned! And shame on you, Fidelity, for giving me false information and completely failing to inform me of your actions on my accounts. Long story: I've had a Fidelity CMA joint account for parking cash plus a couple Roth accounts for my son and I for almost a year now. All of my credit card/other bills come out of my Fid account and I've always been very happy with their customer service. Three weeks ago, I noticed an unusually long hold time of almost a month on a couple incoming ACH transfers; when I called to inquire, they said because of industry-wide fraud, they were temporarily changing their settlement times on incoming funds to 21+ days, and they recommended wiring money in to pay my immediate bills. The Fid rep I talked to recommended cancelling my incoming transfers so I could get the funds in in a more efficient way, like pushing them in from external accounts vs. pulling them in via Fid, so I did that. ... (cont. in comments)",ls3jpgm,Fidelity,"You need to have your attorneys send them a mail with action required.  We had to do this one time to them and they answer IMMEDIATELY.

Fidelity is a good brokerage, but they cross the line sometimes by closing accounts without notice.  I use my attorneys from my trust matters to deal with this crap when it happens.  

Also, I highly recommend you use multiple brokerages such as Schwab and Vanguard as well, split up your investments between each.

Finally, use multiple banks to store intermediate funds that you use regularly and have backup local credit unions.

If you are at home a lot and have it secured, I'd also recommend holding a bit of cash and some gold/silver bars... not too much, but enough to get you by if something bad happens.

Always be prepared for this kind of crap, it's only going to get worse.  But you DO need some attorneys on your side - they don't charge me unless I use them... and Fidelity is the worst in my experience pulling this crap.

Edit: BTW, Schwab has been the best overall - never had to deal with crap from them and they've been quite good on the phone when called.",-1,deafhoney,2,1729025114,2024-10-15 20:45:14,15 October 2024

My FreeTrade Points of concern:,o96gtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreetradeApp/comments/o96gtl/my_freetrade_points_of_concern/,"I have used FreeTrade as a brokerage for nearly a year now and have liked them for the most part. However there is a few things I wish they would change. 

1. Maximum sell limit £25,000
2. Transfer in and out of ISA ( US Stocks ) 
3. Limit orders for Fractional’s and Whole shares combined.

The above I have great concerns regarding especially in drastic changes in price. Positions like $AMC and $GME have increased in price over 2000%+ this year and if someone is holding a larger amount of shares a small limit of £25,000 could hurt their overall profits when coming to sell. 

I have personally been contacting the FreeTrade team each day to raise my concerns, if you feel the same then I would advise doing the same. 

Thanks all :)",h3ah3g4,FreetradeApp,"I thought the limit was £25k for US stocks and £12.5k for UK stocks.

So there's a _""bug""_  which limits fractional sell orders at £12.5k?

MAJOR ISSUES with the IB Desktop for Mac Sillicon,1ip7pd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibkr/comments/1ip7pd3/major_issues_with_the_ib_desktop_for_mac_sillicon/,"I noted some issues below. 

Anybody experiencing these too?

The UI is rendering so many inaccurate values and weird errors which are obvious to any developer that I am wondering if that application has any use to anybody.

",mcprogi,ibkr,"I could go on and on …like highlighting of selected elements which the app does in some contexts in others not or different, ""add"" buttons for watchlists or search fields are nested in navigation bars at the end, the whole watchlist management is weird… you can not unselect in the collection when clicking the ""heart"" button of the itemview and if the list gets long, then you can not scroll to the bottom and hit ""done""… hitting ""enter"" doesnt work…

Thank you.,lj3os66,Etoro,Happy to see all these questions because I see no reason to “trust” in copy trading.

Struggling with stop losses on Webull.,1jbgbwa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jbgbwa,"Hi, folks! It's my first day in futures trading—taking my first steps—and I'm struggling with stop losses on Webull.

1. Why were my stop losses and target price removed? Was it because they were day orders or something? Do I currently have an active long position without stop losses? What happened on Sunday—will I be rich or broke? :)

2.Previously, I had a position where the stop loss was either canceled or didn’t execute, and I couldn’t modify my order—it was grayed out (see the second image). So I was ""forced"" to monitor it myself. :) Is this a normal situation for futures trading?

What can I do to prevent this from happening? Thanks!",mhvhd3t,webull,"Hey there! Welcome to the world of futures trading! It can definitely feel like a wild ride at first, especially with the stop loss stuff. 

1. About your first question, if your stop losses and target prices were removed, it could be because you set them as day orders, which can expire at the end of the trading day. A good way to avoid running into this is to set them as GTC (Good Till Canceled) orders if you want them to stick around longer. As for your long position being active without stop losses, you might want to double-check in the trades tab to see what's going on.

2. For the issue with modifying your order, that can happen if your position is too close to the market price or if there’s high volatility. It’s not an uncommon situation, but it's definitely a headache when you can't control it! 

To prevent these issues in the future, make sure to monitor your trades regularly and familiarize yourself with how Webull handles orders. Try setting your stop losses a bit further away to give yourself some breathing room. Good luck, and may your trading journey be a profitable one!",0,GodSpeedMode,4,1742013763,2025-03-15 4:42:43,15 March 2025

All Joint Accounts messed up?,17rgbad,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/17rgbad/all_joint_accounts_messed_up/,"TDAmeritrade only had one account for joint accounts. For the secondary account holder (eg your spouse) they only stored name, social, mailing address, and phone number.

HOWEVER, TDAmeritrade never updated the mailing address for the secondary account. It stayed the same as when the account was first created.

Schwab, on the other hand, creates an account for each individual. So they created millions of accounts for secondary account holders with no way of reaching them.

Example: They have my wife’s name/social, and her mailing address and employment information from 15 years and four moves ago. They have no way of contacting her to ask her to do this. Nor have they bothered to try.

TL;DR:
If you had a TDAmeritrade joint account, you MUST tell your secondary account holder to contact Schwab themselves to finalize setting up their new account. Schwab seems unable to realize this or to let people know about the problem.",kbisqgw,tdameritrade,"After being with TDA and seeing Schwab I have 1 question: Why did the SEC allow this merger/buyout of TDA clients. Schwab doesn't provide the information about stocks that TDA provided even though according to them ""EVERYTHING IS GOING TO STAY THE SAME"". NOPE! Their platform is junk. I would like to know what person in the SEC got paid to let this happen, because there's no way any intelligent person would have investigated these 2 platforms and said ""sure you can continue with your buyout and wreak havoc on small  investors"". I didn't choose Schwab for a reason, and here we are.",-1,micheal31669,1,1701416945,2023-12-01 7:49:05,01 December 2023
Schwab Blew It: Who’s With Me?,1b33irq,https://i.redd.it/tt48ajhzpjlc1.jpeg,"Schwab Blew It: Who’s With Me?

I’ve been with TD Ameritrade for 14 years. The TD Ameritrade Mobile App (not ThinkOrSwim) is the best mobile trading app for your average American middle class stiff trying to make it in the trading world. That Schwab did not just co-opt it and slap their name on it is the stupidest business decision they’ve made in the acquisition of TD Ameritrade. I will utilize the TD Ameritrade Mobile App until its very end and then yank every cent out of my TD Ameritrade accounts. I’ll follow all of the transitioning process for Schwab right up until “go time” and then pull the rug. I will put all my money in one of Schwab’s competitor accounts if they don’t salvage the TD Ameritrade Mobile App. They will never earn a dime of my money or business. Who’s with me?",ksvoc44,tdameritrade,Thanks. I was hoping you were referring to the TD Ameritrade Mobile app and not Thinkorswim. I have and use Thinkorswim and I don’t like it.

TD API risk,1b3vz6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/1b3vz6b/td_api_risk/,"My acct is final batch to be moved on 10 May.  The API team, while responsive, have been less than clear on what happens to the API access on the day.  The documentation is now dated with last real update 1 year ago promising they were working on a Schwab API.

Given Schwab has no API docs and the website has not progressed and given the fuzzy response from TD on the API, I'm left conclude that perhaps TD will simply walk away from the API on the 10th. I can understand this as simply a business decision, who is using the API and how much in commissions is it generating. I have to presume only a small fraction of the TD base uses the API and perhaps an even smaller % use it for live trading. 

If my fears are indeed true, the question is who might you recommend as an alternative:

TastyTrade - I looked at their API and sadly it looks not very well thought out, doesn't appear you can get quotes without using some funky streaming service. Sounded like lots of work. But their client software is well done.

Tradier - seems to have a simple easy to use API, but their website and client look a little light in terms of capabilities.

E\*Trade - haven't looked at in depth, their API website started talking about Java and that immediately lead me to conclusion this was elderly effort started years ago and simply hasn't been killed off.

Welcome your thoughts/opinions on this.",ksx3off,tdameritrade,"I wrote last week to the Schwab API team and this is what they responded:

We are still working out couple things, once that is done we will then begin onboarding individual developers to start using Schwab Trader API. We estimate we will be able to release Schwab Trader API sometime by the end of the first quarter, dates are still tentative.
I've added your email to the priority review list.

You would be able to track your application approval on Schwab developer portal under API Products at the top -> click on the ""Trader API – Individual” in the top right corner it will show the current status of your API request.",0,2ndchapter,0,1709331885,2024-03-01 22:24:45,01 March 2024

Help improve IBKR,r5gxv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/interactivebrokers/comments/r5gxv2/help_improve_ibkr/,"Hello everyone,

This takes you to the ""New Features Poll"". Similar to a bug tracker, this is a centralized place for both users and for the dev team at IBKR to track change requests and ideas.

Changing totem as a shaman?,14jfvo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/vanguard/comments/14jfvo0/changing_totem_as_a_shaman/,"Hi all, I'm a huge fan of shapeshifting in MMOs. I read online that shaman is a great shapeshifting class, but im a bit concerned because from what I read, you seem to pick a single totem and thats the only form you get for that character. There's nothing wrong with that per se, I'm just trying to fill the WoW Druid-shaped hole in my heart and I really like having multiple shapeshift forms i can swap between.

Is there any means to swap from bear to wolf to pheonix on one character? And does shaman have other shapeahift forms i didn't notice when reading the ability descriptions?",jpltt0g,vanguard,"The shaman picks a patron that determines what abilities they have later on.  You can only have one at a time. Though you can change it, you have to go through a process to change it, so it can't be done on the fly.

Druids can shapeshift into a wolf and at a later point, can turn their entire raid into wolves!

Psionicists can turn themselves into any of the other races in game. Mostly for fluff.

However, there are a lot of shapeshifting items in game that are entirely fluff or for fun. But Vanguard is one of the few games that allows you to continue adventuring while under the use of these items. We had an entire raid of badgers once. And one of the GMs turned our entire raid into camels.  Fun times.",0,TheJavamancer,8,1687796784,2023-06-26 16:26:24,26 June 2023

IBKR without fails sends emails to let me know there is a msg for me in the ""message center"" and doesn't include the actual message. Naturally I try to view the msg on the iOS app... But... how do I get to the ""msg center"" ? It has to be under the ""More"".

Is it in the ""Nofitications"" ? No it's not.

Is it under iBot with permanently has a red dot on it ? No its not there.

Should I go into settings ? Doesn't make sense... but let me check anyway. No it's not.

Is it under ""Account Management"" ? oh wait... I need to do a step up authentication now, but returned to the home screen.

Let me go back into More/AcctMgmt. Ah there it is... the ""Message Center"".

But the msg center has no messages! oh wait... I have to tap the on the hamburger icon to select ""Corporate Actions"" and there it is.

Another web page redo...

I am afraid I tend to notice changes for the worse more than changes for the better.

The content is about 18% of the width of the computer screen. I have to scroll right using a horizontal scroll bar on the sub-window to see the deadline date.

Further, I have to click on Show More to to see more than 10.

I feel I am being treated to cellphone screen sized payloads. My computer screen is not being utilized.

HTML was designed to be able to adapt to different screens and be formatted according to the needs/settings of the user. But now it is the web artist who decides the formats and screen utilization. Large spacing is being added between content lines.  It's not just Fidelity.",mmf666h,Fidelity,"Thanks for trying that out. It is very interesting. 

For a different issue I have used several browsers and cleared cookies, but I have not tried that yet with Fidelity. So this is not a big deal for me, but I guess it was big enough to comment.  Let me also say that the Summary, Positions, and Balances may have improved, and somehow I did not post that. ;-)

Expanding or contracting browser zoom level does not change the format for me, but just makes the stuff smaller or larger. My Windows Scale is 100%.

To be clear, it is the table that starts this way that I call payload:

Are a lot of popular investors just buying major stocks?,1fwbunr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Etoro/comments/1fwbunr/are_a_lot_of_popular_investors_just_buying_major/,Are they just buying stocks in companies like google and apple and just topping them up on dips? Or are they genuinely doing something skilled?,lqf8uhg,Etoro,"Cadet PI here, I assign weights to my holdings and rotate in and out of sectors, regions and assets when I think or feel market conditions have changed enough. I set targets for most of my holdings.

But I've seen sooo many other PIs with stale portfolios. Some of them just basically got lucky with Nvidia or Bitcoin a few years ago and are ridding that wave until their portfolio crashes 50% or more. You can spot these PIs becuse they have few holdings, maybe 1-15, and risk scores of 5 or more over the last year. They'll never admit this publicly of course, and they post garbage they copy from other sources to make them look like they know what's going on.

And there are a handfull of okish PIs with consistent performance.

In the end we all use the astrology equivalent in the financial world to try and predict what's next, which will work from time to time, but over the long run no PI will match the SP500. In the short term some will greatly outperform  because they're at the right place at the right time.

PIs that just buy tech stocks, be it on dips, dca, or whatever, will have great performance until they don't. At that point they'll double down on a losing strategy and drag their copiers into mediocre performance at best.",0,Prudent_Judgment3036,2,1728112123,2024-10-05 7:08:43,05 October 2024

Fidelity doesn't seem as ""trader friendly"" as TD but other than that not sure what there is to say, they are both zero-commission and for basic stock transactions either is fine.    

Personally I wouldn't switch from TD to Fidelity unless there is something specific about TD that you don't like

These orders' prices are not reflected in the candlesticks.,mmhbrpc,thinkorswim,"What you’re looking at is an ISO order, it’s an order type used by institutions to sweep as much liquidity as possible below a certain price across multiple exchanges. It’s used in an effort to prevent front running by HFT whenever very large institutional buying/selling is happening. The price always comes through a bit weird in the T&S data on TOS, I imagine because these large orders are being filled at multiple prices across multiple exchanges and it’s not an order type that’s within the NBBO, but that’s what this anomaly is. 

There were similar ISO orders coming through T&S on SPY all day, 126k lots consistently and I tallied about 15-20 of them with the price listed on each one being 543.8155 (which SPY was never at today).

New to Fidelity and don’t understand cash available to trade,1hc1k81,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1hc1k81/new_to_fidelity_and_dont_understand_cash/,"I just joined Fidelity and have never invested before. About 3 days ago, I moved some money from my bank account to Fidelity. It now appears as “cash available to trade” (however my “settled cash” remains zero). I have not made any trades or anything yet. When I go to try to purchase FXAIX, however, I get a warning on something about committing a good faith violation. What’s that about and does it have to do with my settled cash being $0? How long does my “cash available to trade” actually become available for me to purchase FXAIX? TIA",m1kn444,Fidelity,"Cash available for trade means exactly that. You can use it to purchase securities, bonds, etc. That includes FXAIX.

A Good Faith Violation occurs when you SELL a security with funds that have not fully settled yet.  Fidelity is saying that deposit that was recently made has not fully settled yet. They are letting you trade with it for now, but until that settlement finishes you can’t sell that position. (So no day trading!)

Now… how long until those funds actually settle?  If you use Fidelity to pull money out of your external bank, it can take 3 weeks to fully settle. If you instead push the money from your external bank into Fidelity, it will settle in 24-73 hours typically. You can also wire money into Fidelity and have same day settlement typically. 

That Good Faith note is simply a warning not to sell before the original deposit settles. As long as you are simply buying for long term holding, it has literally zero impact to you.",0,RadioRob-DC,6,1733945605,2024-12-11 19:33:25,11 December 2024

Could you please help me on my below queries?  
  
1. There is no charges for buying or selling US stocks (like Apple/Google) in WealthSimple if you are a premium user. But there will be 1.5% cost during CAD to USD conversion as well as an additional 1.5% in return conversion from USD to CAD. Is that correct?  
  
2. If I want to bypass 1.5% Wealthsimple conversion charge, should I use EQ bank to hold USD? Do they offer better CAD to USD conversion rate?   
  
3. Do transferring USD from another Canadian bank like EQ to Wealthsimple incur any charges?  
  
4. If I would like to use Norbert Gambit process, which brokerage account should I use? Can I use a brokerage account like Questrade/IBKR to do Norbert Gambit to convert CAD to USD & the transfer that USD to Wealthsimple to buy US stocks for free?  
  
Please provide your valuable insights to these questions. Thank you.",m0ghhsz,ibkr,"Your forgetting the fact that EQ bank will give you a terrible exchange rate. IBKR has the literal exact exchange rate listed on Google sometimes better. What I recommend is you transfer CAD to IBKR then convert CAD to USD (no norbert gambit needed) then if you really want no fees you can select to transfer native USD to your bank then from native USD bank to Wealthsimple.

Until they charged me ""withholding tax"" on UK dividends.

The problem? There is no withholding tax on UK dividends,

I live in Ireland and Irish residents do not pay withholding tax on dividends from UK shares. This area of tax law hasn't changed since 1999.

They blamed their depository for the deduction of withholding tax and told me to consult my tax advisor.

No other broker has ever managed to do this to me. What gives?",mhs3yn5,InteractiveBrokers,"If you have a statement or a report from IBKR that states that the deduction is Withholding Tax, it's irrelevant if they have paid it to HMRC - you can claim it back.

And separately, if you do have that statement that states that it is Withholding Tax on UK non-REIT companies, I'd consider including that in a formal complaint to IBKR to avoid it happening again.",-1,meridian_05,2,1741972861,2025-03-14 17:21:01,14 March 2025

Best / cheapest way to get my Xrp into the wallet,1hc3cxk,https://i.redd.it/ubdpr72n5a6e1.jpeg,"Hi newbie here..I have these three open xrp trades that I  want to transfer into my e torro wallet (to then send to my exodus wallet) unfortunately all three are frustratingly below the transfer limit of 120 xrp..

T-margin account questions,1juqsv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/interactivebrokers/comments/1juqsv8/tmargin_account_questions/,"I was wondering why is there a minimum amount or margin I need to take? my initial margin is currently about 25% of my total net liquidation value. Why is this minimum enforced? Isn't it better for the broker that my margin % is less? It means less risk in general both for me and the broker.

  
Also, if I understood it correctly, I would be forced to close positions if the SMA hits 0 or less? (excess liquidity-maintenance margin)",mm52kkr,InteractiveBrokers,"I will watch them, maybe it clarifies it, because I still don't get it. The amount of money I have invested is 4 times as much as the initial margin amount displayed on IBKR for me. My buying power is the 4X that you mentioned.

Does Merrill Edge have similar funds to Fidelity's SPAXX or SPRXX? Can you buy Treasury bills on ME for 1 month exp and at 5.4%?,1emzypw,https://www.reddit.com/r/MerrillEdge/comments/1emzypw/does_merrill_edge_have_similar_funds_to_fidelitys/,"Hi everyone, 

I am new to the Merrill Edge community and have a few questions for loyal/knowledgeable clients of the brokerage. 

I currently use Fidelity and buy 1 month exp T-bills at 5.358% and the money that is left over (1K min for T-bills), I put in SPRXX for 5.07%. 

My reason for wanting to make the switch is because I have the BOA Customized Cash Card and want to optimize my returns and get the 4.5% or 5.25% on the online shopping category depending on how much I decide to transfer over. 

So this leads me to my question. Does Merrill Edge have similar funds to Fidelity's SPAXX or SPRXX that are fee free and yield 5%+ monthly payout? Also, could I invest the majority of my CMA balance into T-bills? For example, if I have $50,368, I would invest 50k into a T-bill and $368 into a FEE FREE fund. If these answers are both yes, would I just create a CMA account on ME's website and then link to my BOA account to get the Platinum Status?

Please let me know if this is a good idea. Is Merrill Edge worth it? Any downsides to doing this? My logic was since I already have all of this money getting 5% in funds and T-bills with this brokerage, I mind as well get all that and a credit card benefit with another. It should be the same thing/process. Right?",lh45fzu,merrilledge,"Texas here too.  I use FISXX because, well I don’t remember why.  Anyway, it’s a fidelity fund, invests in essentially the same stuff as SPAXX.  As noted elsewhere you have to manually buy it and sell it, which is a distinct pain in the butt.  So if you need something like a checking account it’s not going to work, but if you want to shove money away for an upcoming expense, it works fine.

Also note that the yield is expressed as an annual figure, not monthly, and if short term rates go down, expect the yield on FISXX (and the rest of the money market universe) to also go down.",0,secretfinaccount,2,1723128307,2024-08-08 14:45:07,08 August 2024

Is non-registered investing a tax nightmare these days?,1jc8957,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wealthsimple/comments/1jc8957/is_nonregistered_investing_a_tax_nightmare_these/,"I'm thinking of the situation of passive investing of just buying and holding ETFs and a few stocks (not a lot of trading).  Is it a tax nightmare, where all the trading that goes-on on your behalf, generates a ton of tax slips, and do you need to do all kinds of tracking of ACB and book value?  Or is all of this done automatically for you at WS, and you never need to track anything?

Also, if you do your taxes through WS as well as investing, does that make it easier (do they integrate better than doing taxes elsewhere)?

Lastly, if you do the above (invest and do taxes at WS), does it complicate things at tax time if you have investments elsewhere (Questrade for example).

Basically, if it's more complicated than a GIC, then I start to have heart palpitations.

Edit: Thanks for the responses.  A lot of good info to read and digest.  You can see why I ask, as there are some widely varying opinions, and hence why I get heart palpitations :-)  But I think the basics are sinking-in for me.",mi5qgoc,Wealthsimple,"Yeah, good luck with that...

Schwab (if you are listening!) needs to implement it as a DRAWING, so that it can be anchored at different points for different stocks.  The way it is done today, it will retain the same point in time when you look at different stock charts.  

The marginal improvement I mentioned is that if you right click on the chart now, you can change the anchor point.

The broker gets paid by market makers to route trades to them. Almost all brokers do it. I know fidelity doesn't and ibkr doesn't for ibkr pro (they do for ibkr lite). This impacts your execution price on market orders. Fidelity has the best execution improvements based on reports. I also see this when I trade. Fidelity is #1. However etrade and schwab are decent compared to interactive brokers lite, webull, robinhood, and moomoo. These are all the brokers I've tried. If you only use limit orders, it shouldn't impact you.

High-Net-Worth Individuals at Wealthsimple — What's your experience been like?,1jx3vez,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wealthsimple/comments/1jx3vez/highnetworth_individuals_at_wealthsimple_whats/,"I currently have all my investments ($1M+) with private wealth management at RBC and TD, and I'm seriously considering moving it all to Wealthsimple. For the usual reasons: more modern and flexible products, better user interface and self-serve tools, and of course drastically lower fees.

This is a major decision for my family, and the thought of moving my investments *anywhere* is nerve-racking. But I feel like I'm getting ripped of at the big banks, and boutique wealth managers aren't much better.

The CIPF coverage obviously helps alleviate some worst-case-scenario concerns.

But I'm curious to know how HNWIs ($1M+) who have moved from private wealth management to Wealthsimple feel about their experience:

* How painful was transferring assets?
* If you're happy and plan to stay with Wealthsimple: why?
* If you're unhappy and left (or plan to leave) Wealthsimple: why?
* Pros & cons compared to your previous strategy?
* Overall, would you recommend?

Having all your liquid assets tied to a single account is boneheaded when resolving issues can only be done by playing tag with a person via email, phone, or chat. I see people complaining about seemingly minor things that lead to their entire account being locked for weeks or longer. Passing crypto to/from wallets flagged as related to gambling will lock your entire account, entering the incorrect pin too many times at a POS has locked entire accounts, having a recurring bank transfer fail has locked entire accounts, *outgoing* transfers to closed bank accounts have locked entire accounts, people flagging their own account as insecure when they lose their debit card, people not updating their account when they renew their government ID, dummies losing access to the phone number tied to their account when they switch phone plans or services, people forgetting to copy MFA keys to a new device when they upgrade, people travelling abroad with the debit card location protection still on, people failing to cover a margin call, etc. That's just a sample of what I see fairly regularly. Heck, all you need is someone's email address and you could initiate an investigation that'll last days or weeks with a single message sent to report@robinhood.com telling them that it has been compromised.

Only a moron would have their entire financial life bound to Robinhood or Acorns or Webull or M1 or Public or whatever they think has the most fun and awesome app or gives them the best referrals.

Please tell me how I screwed up Stop order on credit spread in ToS.,1asd1pv,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/1asd1pv/please_tell_me_how_i_screwed_up_stop_order_on/,"First of all not new to options trading but newer to trading with ToS and I guess you could say I'm a bit new to using a stop losses on credit spreads since Fidelity didn't have that. So [I sold a credit spread for $5.58](http://tinyurl.com/25olq34t). After 5 minutes stock wasn't making the bull run I had anticipated so decided to set a stop loss. Forgetting that I'm short, I mistakenly set stop price for the spread at $4.58 (when in actuality should have set it at $6.58 if I wanted $100 max loss having to buy spread back). The order immediately executed, debiting my account for $9.39 thus resulting in a $381 loss. Regardless of getting the stop price wrong, the stop is still supposed to execute the buy at market price which certainly was not $9.39 at the time. As you can see in my screenshot the mark of the spread was at $5.60, and the price of the spread did not fluctuate +-$.50 within the 5 minute period that I held the spread. So what the hell happened?!!",kqppay0,tdameritrade,"The mantra is don't use stop orders for options trading.  But if you're going to anyway, then you should probably have used a stop limit order, because the market order that results from a stop order isn't guaranteed to execute at the price that triggered the stop.  At least with a stop limit order, you lose guaranteed execution after the stop is triggered, but get a guaranteed price if it does execute.

On illiquid instruments like options, it's so easy to accidentally trigger a stop or get a horrible fill on a market order.  If there is only one party maintaining the order that dictates the current bid or ask, and they momentarily cancel their order, then if your market order hits during that moment, you'll get filled at the order at the next best price, which could be cents or dollars away from the cancelled order.",0,Dachannien,4,1708104607,2024-02-16 17:30:07,16 February 2024

Also, when stocks are volatile but on the way up they set quantity limits that are not stated anywhere. Happened yesterday with APHA and has happened with PLTR, FEYE and SPCE to me in the past.

Sadly I don't think you can translate your positions directly. You'll have to do it ""analogically"" by withdrawing the funds and applying them elsewhere with fresh and, I guess, worse positions as you will not inherit the entry of the others.

But I feel like without context we don't know if these set up are working all smooth and stuff at like 9:30 am when its the craziest time. How many charts or scripts they have etc

Right now I am to either buy a prebuilt desktop or buy one from [Dell.com](http://Dell.com) I guess dell.com. 

I read some people just say, get a gaming computer and you'll be fine. I dont feel quite confident in that answer though because TOS isn't graphic card heavy right? I mean I've seen people mentioning gaming pc and the person is just using a laptop. So I take umbrage with that advice,

My  current set up is

The Dell XPS 15 9560 is a laptop that was released in 2017. It has a 15.6-in LED display, 32 GB of DDR4-2400MHz RAM, and a 512 GB PCIe solid state drive. It also has NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 4GB DDR5 graphics and runs Windows 10 Professional 64bit English. Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80GHz   2.80 GHz

I factory restarted the computer to only have a few programs on it  
I only have TOS and sometimes chrome running. A lot of times the GPU is being maxed out by DWM and I dont know why. I even try to set it to be used by the NVIDIA GPU and it doesn't. I've togggled the hardware acceleration in the graphics settings too.

I want to run OBS in the future.

I have 3, 2k monitors connected to a thunderbolt dock.

3. Supplementary Fee (3%)

B. Is there anyway he can get out of it?
C. Is there anyway ethical guidelines?

",mmicv97,singaporefi,"Besides the other good advice there are legal clinics in Singapore that can give you legal advice for free.

I would suggest you prepare documents that supports facts as best you can.

* Medical documentation for dementia
* The ILP
* Any written/recorded abusive behavior by the agent
* The relevant dates of interacting with the agent etc.

Lawyers love bullet points they can digest, together with supporting documentation.

It’s possible you have other avenues to pursue against the agent that a lawyer can help you with, and getting a law firms letter on a complaint is taken a lot more serious than a customer complaint.

In one quick move, you eliminated the trust I've built up in Fidelity over 16 years of doing business with you. You deleted my post (via rule #10 - we do what we want) which was the only way that customers could know they will not be able to withdraw funds for 3-4 weeks when they send them into fidelity via EFT. There is NO other notification that funds will be unavailable this long and, while we're fortunately able to handle this, many customers will rely on these funds for rent, groceries, etc. and can't handle their money being unavailable for 7-10 times as long as the app says.

I really don't wanna a BOA checking acct,mbadtcf,merrilledge,"I think you need one to get preferred rewards, but you don’t need to use it. It’s a good idea to have more than one checking account in case one has a problem. There are horror stories of banks suddenly choosing to freeze accounts with no understandable reason. Maybe they have KYC quotas, though that seems unlikely.

Fidelity CMA is a good option. You can invest the funds in FDLXX. The yield is a little less than TTTXX, but you can withdraw money without having to sell first, and they will credit ATM fees anywhere.

Fidelity is actually an example of the reason to have multiple accounts. They don’t have traditional retail banking locations for depositting cash, and a few months ago they stopped accepting mobile check deposits of more than $1000 for many customers because they were experiencing meme-level deposit fraud.

In such a case you could deposit money and checks to your ~0% interest Bank of America checking account, electronically transfer some to Merrill TTTXX paying 4.4%, and some to Fidelity FDLXX paying 4.2%. The advantage would still remain with the funds held at Fidelity always being available to withdraw as cash or to use to pay bills and write checks.",0,rz2000,2,1738848420,2025-02-06 13:27:00,06 February 2025

On November 20, after hours EST, this AI chip giant company is set to release its Q3 FY2025 financial results. Looking ahead to the third quarter, the market generally expects Nvidia to achieve revenues of $33.028 billion, an 82.27% increase YOY; earnings per share are anticipated to be $0.7, up 88.11% YOY. This also means that the company is expected to achieve record-breaking revenue and profits for the sixth consecutive quarter. However, just before the earnings release, this Sunday The Information reported that Nvidia's new Blackwell AI chip is facing delivery delays due to overheating issues with its accompanying servers. ""Nvidia is working with leading cloud service providers as an integral part of our engineering team and process. The engineering iterations are normal and expected,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.

I'll make some super simple examples so that its clear.  I understand its different for Reg-T and portfolio margin so lets just do Reg-T examples for now to make it simple.  Let's also assume the interest they pay you is 5% and the margin they charge you on stocks is 6%.  Let's also assume the account starts out with 100k cash in each example (they aren't cumulative).

Example 1:

Buy 100k of spy (20% margin requirement is 20k).  What will be the daily interest charge or payment?

Example 2:

Buy 200k of Spy (20% margin requirement is 40k).  What will be the daily interest charge or payment?

Example 3: Sell a naked OTM put on 50k of SPY.  Let's just say you collect 1k in premium.  So now you have 101k of cash and a 10k margin requirement.  What will be the daily interest charge calculation?

Example 4: Sell a naked OTM put on 250k of SPY.  Let's just say you collect 5k in premium.  SO now you have 105k of cash and a 50k margin requirement.  What will be the daily calc?

Example 5: Buy 100k worth of SPY (20k margin requirement), and also sell a naked OTM put for 100k worth of SPY (20k margin requirement).  Let's just say you collect 2k in premium.  What will be the daily calc?

My account balance is $6,000 and like I said, I plan on taking two trades with a total of $2,400ish initial margin. Will I be greatly susceptible to a margin call if I am intraday swing trading? I wish TOS would give me a number so I can know what the max drawdown they will allow me to take is. Maybe I’m not fully understanding something, I’ve spent the last two years trading options in a cash account and I’m relatively new to using margin. So is $2,400 initial margin too high for a $6,000 TD Ameritrade account that is doing intraday swing trades?",jdonnxf,tdameritrade,"Sometimes, intial margin can be super lown you can file a form for even more reduced initial that is targeted for day trading leverage. They also recalc at close 4.30 each day as the maintance can change esp on high vol days.

Funds Stuck in Merrill?,1bcgedx,https://www.reddit.com/r/MerrillEdge/comments/1bcgedx/funds_stuck_in_merrill/,"Thanks in advance for the help!

Situation: I transferred money from a savings account into Merrill Edge, but overlooked that the funds were actually in that bank’s checking account, so the initial pull bounced. I received a message from the bank that it bounced, so I moved funds into the savings account. I never received a message from Merrill that it did, so Merrill retried the pull and pulled funds from the bank. The bank put in the memo line item that it was a retry payment. However, it’s now been 10 days and the funds are still processing, but the funds are no longer in my bank account.

I’ve been receiving mixed messages from Merrill, with some reps telling me that they’ll just need another day to clear and others telling me that the funds are on the way back to my bank. However, the funds are very clearly not in my bank account anymore and not accessible on Merrill. 

Has anyone been in this situation before? Thank you again!

(Not that you asked, but FXAIX and VOO are basically the same fund. I’d change the VOO to VTI which is a total market index fund. There’s overlap even with FXAIX and VTI, but VTI gives you some mid and small cap stocks.

What's good about Merill other than the preferred rewards?,1d3l2n0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MerrillEdge/comments/1d3l2n0/whats_good_about_merill_other_than_the_preferred/,"I just opened an account with Merill, primarily for the purposes of preferred rewards enrollment and some extra joining bonus of $1000. However, so far, my experience with them hasn't been great. While the customer care representatives have been very good in resolving all the issues, the website lacks so many basic features that I took forgranted with fidelity.

So far, I have seen these issues -

1. No auto-sweep functionality whatsoever. Need to manually buy and sell money market funds to earn any interest. Readily available cash earns 0.01% interest (a joke).
2. No way to buy treasury bills at auction from the website. I guess this is a well known issue and was known to me apriori too. But, just listing it out here.
3. No way to add an external bank account with 2 tiny deposits. They are using some Yodlee instant verification method which doesn't work with my accounts at Fidelity held at UMB Bank. Apparently, I need to send a form to link a bank account along with a voided check.

Overall, these dark patterns make it very clear that Merill wants to make it as difficult as possible to move cash out of it, or earn any interest on the case sitting in the account.

I have almost decided to move all money in excess of $100K after the 3 month period. However, I would like to know if there are any other good things about Merill that I have not seen or am missing out on. I do like their Portfolio Story and other such visualizations. Also, having access to Bank of America research reports is an added plus. Other than these, I do not see how Merill can compete with what Fidelity has to offer. What are your thoughts?",l69lnam,merrilledge,"Whoa, why the hostility? This was my first reply on your thread.

Transfer Failed - NO HELP from Trading 212,1jn7u3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/trading212/comments/1jn7u3x/transfer_failed_no_help_from_trading_212/,"I, like so many others initiated a transfer out of Vanguard in December 2024 from my Stocks and Shares ISA to Trading 212.

Despite what felt like an age I got an email on 20 March 2025 from Trading 212 that my transfer was complete. However, only half of my portfolio has come over, the VUSA shares. The other half which were VUAG show on the app as ""Transfer failed, we have sent you an email with more information"". I have no such email. Vanguard mentions that all shares have transferred out successfully. But half my portfolio is missing and all I am getting with Trading 212 is the generic ""we are very busy"" and ""you will hear from a transfer specialist in 48 hours"". It's been 10 days; no one has contacted me, and I keep getting generic responses on the app. Literally thousands of pounds are missing. This isn't a good way to start a new financial relationship.

I feel literally ghosted by Trading 212 when literally half my portfolio is missing, not pending or just taking a long time to come over, the funds are literally nowhere. I am about to open a complaint with the ombudsman and blow up on social media if I my funds don't appear in my portfolio this week. I have been more than fair. This is extremely poor.

I can’t be the only one.

America is home to the extremes: incredibly rich people, and then illiterate and irresponsible spenders. Hard to cancel trials, tips and in transparent pricing, etc. It's very hard to ascertain the true price of certain services and goods, and I think that is largely by design.

A good example of this is cruise ship pricing and Airbnb prices in the US vs the rest of the world.

Should I buy a property now or wait? 25M,1jwtqgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1jwtqgz/should_i_buy_a_property_now_or_wait_25m/,"Hey everyone

So I’m in a dilemma now. I’m sitting at 1.35M cash equivalents with my gf from trading windfall and am deliberating to buy a 960 sqft condo for $1.4M.

I’m super burnt out from trading, but managed to keep my portfolio growing slightly. I want to park my money in something real before I start making bad decisions in this crazy market.

Questions :

1) Should I care about the potential downsides of the housing market? (My sense is that it can’t drop more than I can give back to the markets)

2) Should I park more of my money in down-payments to lock it in?

I’m really just fomoing about opportunity cost of losing out investing in a deep bear market.

This is not a bragging session, I’d just like some sense to be talked to me if you’d all kindly oblige. Thank you.",mml8g7z,singaporefi,"Here’s my take, based on what I’ve seen since 1997.

Over the years, I’ve witnessed market cycles—both in equities and real estate. Many of my clients and close friends, now in their 50s to 80s, fully own properties they purchased decades ago. Despite all the ups and downs, their daily lives remain unaffected by market noise. At their age, most of the properties they have invested in are already fully paid up, with no leverage. In fact, some are still actively investing, buying overseas properties when currencies like the yen are low or picking up holiday homes in places like Bangkok.

**Why?** Because owning a hard asset, especially one bought at the right price, offers peace of mind—not sleepless nights.

Here are a few thoughts to consider:

1. **If you're buying a home to live in**, you're either going to pay rent or pay a mortgage. If the numbers make sense and you're not overpaying or over-leveraging, it’s a solid move. There are still fairly priced freehold condos in the East asking between $1,4xx to $1,8xx psf. Even some leasehold units are asking around $1,1xx to $1,4xx psf. It is difficult to put a price on something, especially your home, as long as you are not paying an exorbitant amount, in my opinion. Just be wary of new launches asking high prices—projects in Lentor at $2,6xx psf or Jurong East at $2,3xx psf, for example, may not offer the same value right now.
2. Yes, I will personally I will pay more down payment. I don't like to overgear. channeling some of it into property isn’t a bad idea—especially with current interest rates around 2.6%+. If rates go down in the future, you have the option to refinance (take out some cash). Meanwhile, your money is parked in a tangible asset. Time passes very fast. You might even fully pay off the apartment in 10-15 years.

Ultimately, no one can time the market perfectly. But smart, long-term decisions made with prudence tend to reward people over time.",0,Wannaretirerich,141,1744389760,2025-04-11 16:42:40,11 April 2025

Years of experience by platform.

TD Ameritrade: 10+

e\*Trade: 5+

Schwab: \~3

Interactive Brokers: < 1

I really don't understand why Schwab is moving TD to the Schwab platform when the TD platform is so superior but the piece that I just can't get over is why Schwab didn't take the hover pop-up and move it over when they brought over ToS. That hover popup is so useful on decision making without going off platform. I do all of my screening and analytics with google finance and finviz so I don't need a replacement for that but I do need a data rich holdings platform.

I much prefer the e\*Trade holdings grid to the schwab so I would go there except the lack of the hover pop-up and really bad click through page is close to useless.

With the TD web platform I have everything I desire with the left side with the holdings and hover pop-up and the right side dock customized with all the broader info (news, markets, watchlists). As far as I can tell, no other of the big platforms allow any customizations beyond columns and column order. No widgets, or dock like info, no hover pop-ups with relevant next level stock info.

I like e\*Trade's options screen better than TD's popup but there doesn't seem to be anything better about Schwab on any matters of importance. 

I haven't found anything I like about IBKR.  It seems style over substance.

With 40 days left, I can't believe I'm stuck with Schwab abandoning the 9/10 platform and migrating clients to the simpleton app that works best for buy and hold investing.

I recently deposited 4 checks from my attorney for a little over $10K and was surprised to see the funds would not be available for more than three weeks.

To transfer just had to provide my account number of Charles and had to tell them what kind of account it is (personal brokerage, IRA, Roth, etc) and they are taking care of the transfer. 

Crazy thing is no one reached out from Charles, not one email but I know they got the request as they have stopped me from doing any trading.

Migrating to Schwab has stolen so much of the joy of investing for me. The platform works “well enough,” but is not nearly as conducive an experience as TD Ameritrade was.

It’s such a pain in the ass to do things as mundane as a simple buy order. Feels like I’m signing up for a brokerage account just to buy a share. (Seriously, the default value for a limit order is $0?)

Even the daily market summary audio is dry and uninspiring.

Bank transfers used to be available to me immediately for low-risk trades, but now it seems like I have to wait the full 2-3 days for the ACH to clear.

The only possible silver lining is that, as someone with a curated portfolio that I intend to hold for the long term, I will check my portfolio less, and thus be more likely to “forget” about it.

It was fun while it lasted. I realize Thinkorswim might be an option, but that wasn’t necessary before, and it shouldn’t be now.

I’ve recommended TDAm to multiple new investors looking to get a start, but will now strongly be steering them in other directions.

EDIT: I have found one major positive, to be fair: Schwab Stock Slices. If they work as advertised, they’re basically fractional shares.

Also, the interface for browsing options chains is better than TDAm.

Wealthsimple RRSP Transfered Saved Me Thousands,1juev8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wealthsimple/comments/1juev8g/wealthsimple_rrsp_transfered_saved_me_thousands/,"I think it was a lot of luck. I had started some transfers back in March to transfer the RRSP accounts from TD over WS for their 2% bonus promotions. It got rejected a few times since it turn out to be spousal RRSP accounts and WS didn't have these accounts supported in their transfers. I spent a lot of time with the agents to do this transfer manually.

Fast forward, the accounts have been finally transferred as of now. It looks like the RRSP were liquidated before the Trump Tariffs shocked the market. 

Incredible timing and luck!",mm5q34m,Wealthsimple,My house was bought pre Covid thanks to this. I liquidated my down payment and did terrible math. Instead of 20% did 35%. I was doing some back of napkin calculations and figured 35% down will give me slightly favourable monthly mortgage payments but then down the line decided against it. But totally forgot which calculation was which and liquidated the 35. This was 2 months before the crash and at the peak. Shear luck. Well I am now down to all time just peaking 3% when it was 22% pre tariff. Win some loose some. All in the game.,0,fatpanda0,1,1744172062,2025-04-09 4:14:22,09 April 2025
CS Brokerage,15dzb99,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlesSchwab/comments/15dzb99/cs_brokerage/,"What percent of of your investments should you withdraw yearly? I want to use this account to a: save for future expenses (car, house) b: save for retirement, but also c: add to my income. SO I would like to withdraw a small amount yearly so I can have more money TODAY as well. What's a recommended percentage to withdraw without harming the overall goal?",jw96kjx,CharlesSchwab,"Couple thoughts...so, if you want income now, focus on income producing assets (ex. dividend paying securities or interest generating).  Then could enjoy dividends/interest now instead of having them reinvest. 
For future/savings, look into a mix of growth, some mutual funds or ETFs. Risk tolerance matters a lot as does your time horizon and starting point. Like, did you get a lottery win or just starting out?

How to transfer fidelity Roth IRA to my Merrill edge Roth IRA,u7tktk,https://www.reddit.com/r/MerrillEdge/comments/u7tktk/how_to_transfer_fidelity_roth_ira_to_my_merrill/,"I have $30k in my fidelity Roth IRA which are made up of 2 mutual funds:

1. FZROX $24k
2. FFNOX $6k

I want to exchange first the fzrox to VTI because fzrox can only be held in a fidelity account.

Only exchange $5k of FFNOX to VTI so I have $1k left on my fidelity Roth IRA just to keep the account open.

Reason for transfer? To avail of preferred rewards program by Bank of America.

Question: 
After I exchange fzrox and FFNOX to vti, can I just call Merrill edge and tell them to transfer just the vti from fidelity Roth to my Merrill edge Roth?

Update: I sold FFNOX and fzrox then bought vti, HUUUGE mistake, I should’ve just stayed in cash, went down >$2k as I bought vti @ $220 it’s now $207/share.

"Hi all, I know there's lots of these posts but I had been blindly putting money into the S&P 500 and this last month I've realised I should be spreading across alot more areas. How does everyone think these %'s are for a pie split?",1jef62f,https://i.redd.it/keq1ztxtdipe1.jpeg,"1. Yes I know the majority of All world is weighted towards S&P 500, I am okay with having it and some more exposure with the S&P and FTSE I'm just looking to add other options now too. I'm wondering how would you advise to split these %'s?

2. I want to have some commodities and everyone says 10% gold but was also thinking about having silver as well as a small chunk, what do you think would you add any other commodities?

3. I've added 5% of Poland as I want some exposure to it as I know it's a rapidly growing economy and set to overtake Japan.

If you have any advice or things you'd do differently in my position I'd love to know before I rebalance. This last month has really made me realise that the reliance on American market is not the route to take.

I'm only a relatively young and new investor so please let me know what you think, ready to take on criticism and advice!",mii8guy,Trading212,"I presume this is in stocks-and-shares ISA?

Since you're already invested in S&P500, it would make more sense to buy an ex-US global fund and an emerging markets fund instead of the all-world and set the balance you want separately - or you can take the balance by looking at the regional distribution of the all-world you would've chosen.

As you can see here gold is okay as an inflation hedge, silver is just a crap investment. Bear in mind you could alternatively buy, e.g, inflation-adjusted government bond if you wanted an inflation hedge. I do hold some gold, but in the form of jewelry as personal property enjoys its own tax exemption, I get some consumption value, costs are covered under my standard house insurance arrangements, and if everything were to go to hell it's both concealable and desirable.

freetrade premium price increase,12zhl64,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreetradeApp/comments/12zhl64/freetrade_premium_price_increase/,"the price will increase from 9.99 to 11.99 soon but now they introduced annual subscriptions where you would save 17% which would work out to be 9.99 a month.

is it just me or does other people feel conned with this model? :D",jhym62x,FreetradeApp,"None of the fixed fee brokers are as bare bones as Freetrade though. When you compare them to the competition, they just look bad in every aspect. Then you have T212 giving you a free ISA +1% cash back and an FX fee of 0.15% (Freetrade free account is 0.95%), faster stock price updates, after hours prices, more stocks/ETFs, faster bank withdrawals and that’s just a few. I don’t care what others do with their money but the competition just makes Freetrade look bad. Then the fact you have to delete the account if you decide to change platforms just seems like a bit of a scam. I’d understand if they didn’t let you buy without the monthly fee but they require you to close the account. Not great when the point of an ISA is to have it compound over time.",0,DaedricArmoury,2,1682625092,2023-04-27 19:51:32,27 April 2023
What is “ML DIRECT DEPOSIT PROGRAM”?,149adcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MerrillEdge/comments/149adcg/what_is_ml_direct_deposit_program/,"I took some money out of a money market fund and and am trying to determine what “ML DIRECT DEPOSIT PROGRAM” is. I am reinvesting that money into stocks but the “ML DIRECT DEPOSIT PROGRAM” balance doesn’t go down. Instead, it shows that my cash balance is going negative.

My guess is that the money that I took out from the money market fund has not yet settled but they are still allowing me to spend it, thus making my cash balance negative. After the money from the money market fund has settled, my cash balance will go positive?

Can someone confirm this?",joilst9,merrilledge,"That makes sense, but other brokers I’ve used still don’t allow you to make the second transaction until after the first one has settled. Maybe they were ones just being extra conservative.",0,unknown,1,1687038230,2023-06-17 21:43:50,17 June 2023
Fidelity EFTs Take 3-4 weeks to clear,1fpacn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1fpacn3/fidelity_efts_take_34_weeks_to_clear/,"Since r/fidelityinvestments removed both my original post and my followup, I'll post it here in hopes that it gets to hang around somewhere:

In one quick move, you eliminated the trust I've built up in Fidelity over 16 years of doing business with you. You deleted my post (via rule #10 - we do what we want) which was the only way that customers could know they will not be able to withdraw funds for 3-4 weeks when they send them into fidelity via EFT. There is NO other notification that funds will be unavailable this long and, while we're fortunately able to handle this, many customers will rely on these funds for rent, groceries, etc. and can't handle their money being unavailable for 7-10 times as long as the app says. Linking me to a megathread is useless, because many/most of your customers do not use reddit and I just want you to give them a heads up before they count on you to have their money available in 3-4 days, AS YOUR APP SAYS. Ban me if you will. Next time I encounter an issue with Fidelity, I'm moving my money elsewhere, because this is pathetic customer service to just remove a post instead of saying ""thanks for the feedback - let's fix that"". I don't see a single useful reply from y'all in that thread either. Original post:

I chatted with fidelity and they informed me that a large deposit (for me - $12,500) would not settle for 3 weeks from the date of deposit. This differed from a recent deposit of similar size and also a deposit I'd made since then of ~$4,500. The app still says that deposits will be available 3-4 days after submission, so please be aware this may happen to you & Fidelity, please update the app (and presumably website) to make this clear.",lovyvj4,Fidelity,"This submission appears to be about Fidelity support or customer service.

Want to change Global Settings so that all TRAILSTOPs start at -$.10,1i53xtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkorswim/comments/1i53xtk/want_to_change_global_settings_so_that_all/,"As the title says, I want to change the default value of a TRAILSTOP order from -$.50 to -$.10 in ThinkorSwim (TOS).  TOS seems to default to -$.50, and I can't figure out how to change that.

Here's why I'm looking for this from a strategy perspective:  I like to scalp options plays in fast-moving underlying stocks like TSLA.  I use order templates with fixed quantities and my STOPLOSS set at a predetermined point.  Upon entering the trade, I immediately look for directional profitability, which I usually have.  At that point, I click ""Cancel/Replace Order"" to start moving my STOPLOSS closer to the price, but to also change from the STOPLOSS to a TRAILSTOP order to capture quick profit on the movement before a reversal.

The problem:  When I click on the word ""STOP"" in my change order ticket to bring up a list that contains TRAILSTOP, and I select TRAILSTOP to change to it, the order ticket updates (as it should) but ***always*** defaults to a -$.50 TRAILSTOP.  At that point, I have to manually change that to -$.10, with a couple of keystrokes since the up/down arrow buttons only change the stop by $.01 per click.  Thus, I would like to have -$.10 be the default so that I don't have to keep changing the order ticket in the heat of the moment as I've made a mistake doing so in the past that cost me.

Is there a way to do this?  I keep reading the TOS help pages and numerous posts around the web that try to answer my question, but none seem to work to change that basic setting across ALL order entry tickets.

Thank you for your help!",m82gzkv,thinkorswim,"On my TOS platform, it's not there unless I'm going blind...

Everything else is there:  Default Order type, Default Stop type, Max Qty of Orders, Default Qty of Orders, Order Qty Increments, and Default TIF type, but no Trailstop increment.

I've looked in every available option under every available tab, and I see nothing regarding what I'm looking for.",0,CapeFearElvis,1,1737328446,2025-01-19 23:14:06,19 January 2025

$1 (USD) per trade for stocks listed on UK, Europe, and US exchanges.
$2 (USD) per trade for stocks listed on all other exchanges.""

Seems nobody is talking about the above. I am already planning my move to other brokers.

Bad year to start investing ..,1jumuuv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jumuuv,"Every time I think of putting more into Apple it drops .. might just put in the money and  keep investing monthly and not worrying.. as for the S&P I’m not worried at all as it will 100% recover within 10 years if it gets VERY BAD 

What’s your portfolio looking like 🤣?",mm3vss5,Trading212,"Honestly this is the best year to start investing. Having a market crash is the best time to invest. Don't look at the monetary value of your investment, look at the number of shares you have. Treat this as a consolidation phase and accumulate as much as possible. I DCA every week the same amount regardless of it being green or red idgaf. Just remove emotion and you'll do just fine. I first got into the market during the COVID crash and made fucking bank. This is basically the same IMO.",0,mr_P0Opy_Butth0le,2,1744148286,2025-04-08 21:38:06,08 April 2025
Checking how many round trip day trades I’ve made?,142gpxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlesSchwab/comments/142gpxw/checking_how_many_round_trip_day_trades_ive_made/,Hello all! Former TD user here who is still getting accustomed to the Charles Schwab app. I’m a long term investor but I still do occasionally perform some day trades but have less than $25K in my account.. therefore I can’t perform more than 3 day trades in 5 business days to conform with the PDT rule. I was wondering if there was a way to see how many “round trip trades” I’ve performed so I don’t get dinged. In the TD app it simply told me under my accounts value section… The schwab app appears to be different.,l5bfpz8,CharlesSchwab,Thank you so much!  I loved the TDA app. I’m still trying to learn think or swim app. Can’t grasp it yet either. Schwab absolutely horrendous. I’m so disappointed.

Why are they pushing treasury so hard,196sikt,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreetradeApp/comments/196sikt/why_are_they_pushing_treasury_so_hard/,"Ive been an app user for a few years now.

I dont really understand the Stock market, so I just dump it in a portfolio of cheap etfs wrapped in an isa.

But the marketing they've done around treasury is huge compared to their previous marketing for other new features. It is normally quite low key. I've had loads if emails about cash, and now there is a treasury tab

So, whats in it for them to push, what seems to me, a pretty average person, a rather confusing concept. They must make more?

Thanks !",khvv8ll,FreetradeApp,"I reckon there’s two things

1) you need some good capital to even get a shot at participating on the bids, so they want a solid base regularly signed up for them to stump up the half mil minimum every week (though they can probably fund that from their own assets)

2) they’ll start charging a % fee on the Treasury interest in 2-3 months or so. It gives some growth and upscale added to the MRR if they make it a compelling product returning at > money market & retail savings accounts.

It’s also a bit of a USP and maybe mission defining to make these instruments available to retail customers and ngl even if I wasn’t the target for it, I’m still there for any competition to democratise the market and make it accessible.",0,mister_magic,6,1705273843,2024-01-14 23:10:43,14 January 2024

Fidelity account disappeared into thin air,1e0bvyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1e0bvyu/fidelity_account_disappeared_into_thin_air/,"So about an hour ago I went onto my Fidelity mobile app on my iPhone to see how my stocks in my Roth IRA where doing. It said there was $0 in my account. There was no past transaction history and when I went to look at the profile it said some other guys name. I logged out and logged back in and nothing had changed.

So I called fidelity and the first person I talked to said they couldn't verify my identity and that I should find more information about my employer and to call back at a time if my convenience. I asked what kind of information they wanted and they said they didn't know. Super helpful. 

So I called back immediately talked to another person, similar situation and she put her manager on the phone. He was super condescending and said there was no record or me having an account and was I sure I ever had an account through fidelity. I said I was sure. My entire savings is in this Roth IRA and I transfer $50 automatically into the account every two weeks. He continued to be condescending and tell me it's impossible I ever had an account with them. I told him I have bank statement and emails to prove that's not true. I also went into my email and saw that in the last couple days there had be emails telling me that there had been changes to my account including the phone number. So clearly some kind of fraud is happening right?

So he transfers me to the investing department and that guy was much more friendly and professional but still there is no record of me having an account. He has submitted my information to the fraud department and I should hear back from them soon. 

Has anyone had something like this happen before? How does this even happen? It's not saying much I'm young and poor but that's my entire life saving. 


TL;DR

My fidelity account disappeared and they said it never existed ",lclx3hb,Fidelity,No I don’t keep things like that. Clearly in the future I should. Pretty much all I can find as proof of an account is emails from them with trading stuff and bank transactions with bi weekly transfers. The links in the emails go to an error page though and the account number is blocked out except for the last 4 digits ,0,Far_Philosophy_9183,-4,1720661616,2024-07-11 1:33:36,11 July 2024

They have the phone lines staffed 24/7 and it never takes long for a rep to pick up. They also seem to be American based if that matters to you.

However, a few months ago I had a routine issue that ended up turning into a huge ordeal mostly due to the phone reps not being familiar with how it worked. This dragged on for a month and throughout the process I had many phone calls with different reps and I often got contradictory instructions and advice. I couldn't directly talk to the department that was working on my issue and the phone reps only seemed to communicate with them through notes. There was a lot of miscommunication and it cost me money.

I wouldn't let this discourage you though as the phone reps are nice people who try their best. The CS beats most places, especially nowadays. Just don't try to remove an excess contribution from a Roth IRA at TD Ameritrade lol.",1,Former_Base_3250,1,1680731546,2023-04-05 21:52:26,05 April 2023

Hi everyone! I’m new to trading and just getting started with Thinkorswim. I’m looking to download some good indicators to help with my analysis, but I’m not sure where to find reliable ones.

Do you have any favorite free indicators or sites where I can download them? Any recommendations or advice for a new trader would be really appreciated!

Thanks in advance!",m3admcq,thinkorswim,"1. What are your goals? Daytrading, swing or long term
2. What kind of investor or trader are you? Individual stocks, ETF, forex, etc
3. How conservative or aggressive are you?

I will post here in a few days (don’t have my computer with ToS on me), my standard technicals ‘build’ for you to import… it’ll have a combination of MA, Stochastics, and Bollinger bands. 

I have found that newer traders do well once they understand these and some basic technical analysis and a *strong* knowledge of candlesticks. 

These are the basics. 

Definitely use the Paper Money option to learn & test before using real funds. 

Get good at making a profit, no matter how small and be consistent and have only minimal loses.

After that, you just need to maintain a balance > $0 to continue to get the yield.

Also too many steps just to pull up a candle chart and/or execute a trade! All littered with hints inviting me to let some kid in their office somewhere take over! Why doesn't the signed-in page contain clickable words or buttons to take a self investor directly to the pages they normally use?

New To Investing!,1h2ykw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1h2ykw1/new_to_investing/,"Hi, I’m new to investing and recently started with Fidelity. I’ve got a few questions I’m hoping someone can help me with:
	
1.	Do I need to save up a certain amount of money before I start investing, or can I invest small amounts and keep adding to the same investment over time?
	
2.	I’ve seen people recommend FXIAX. If I start with $50 and want to split it between two investments, should I do that by shares or dollars?
	
3.	When placing an order, should I choose market or limit?

I’m a bit confused about the process, so any clarification would be appreciated. Also, can anyone recommend good beginner-friendly books or resources for learning more about investing?

Thanks in advance for your help!",lzn9rgg,Fidelity,"1. You can start investing with any amount of money. You can add more money into the same investment, or add money to the account and put it towards a different investment.

2. FXAIX is a mutual fund. So you can invest $50 into that fund. With mutual funds, you typically invest a dollar amount. The value of the fund changes each days. Currently it’s roughly $208/share. So a $50 investment on Monday would get you roughly 0.25 shares.  Every time you invest an additional $50, you’d get a different number of shares depending on the current price/share. So you may get 0.25 shares, or 0.27 shares, or 0.15 shares.  But as you continue to invest, you’ll acquire more and more shares.

3. Limit orders are more advanced and not something you need to be concerned with at first.  With mutual funds you typical don’t really use limit orders anyway. 

So for you I’d find one or two mutual funds that you think are good, long-term investments and start putting your money into those.

Remember, investments can go down too, so only invest what you’re willing to lose. That’s rule #1.

Also Fidelity has a TON of resources on investing and trading. From basics to advanced info. Check out the Learning Center (you can search for it in the Fidelity) search bar.",1,MrPancakesMcgee,2,1732929343,2024-11-30 1:15:43,30 November 2024

300k lost,1eat30v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1eat30v/300k_lost/,">OK, I am going to start ignoring replies here. I see that most of them are either blaming me for my ignorance, empathizing with me or allowing this to serve as a reminder that they also need to roll something over. None of which are helpful but at least the empathizers are being nice.  
For those of you that came in here, and spent time to write a post along the lines of ""It's your fault, what kind of dummy doesn't know the rules of a 401k""; go touch some grass. I asked for help getting my money back or insight from the community about what I could do and all you can do is point and laugh? Worthless.  
Thanks to those that offered advice. I am going to continue to pressure Inspira to find my money. That seems like the only thing I can do at this point.

I am going to try and keep this vague to prevent corporate retaliation but here's my tale:

I was notified via LifeLock on 2025-06-16 that hundreds of thousands of dollars were being transferred out of my 401k account with Fidelity. This was not something I had asked for so I immediately thought ""Fraud"". Since it was a weekend I could only reach a basic CSR at Fidelity who told me it was ""Account Maintenance"" and I should wait until Monday and it should be back where it came from. Come Monday the money is still missing.

Got on the horn with a Fidelity 401k specialist who informed me that my former employer (10+ ago) had ended their relationship with Fidelity and my 300k had been transferred to Inspira, a company I have never heard of. The conversation went something like this:

ME: You sent my money somewhere without letting me know it was going to happen?

CSR: Your employer should have let you know.

ME: I have not spoken to, or contacted anyone from that company in around 10 years. Why would they be responsible for contacting me? You are the ones holding my money, you have my email, phone number & current address. You ask me to verify it every 3rd time I log on to your site! Can you get my money back please?

CSR: No, it's already been sent. You will need to contact Inspira.

ME: So you guys sent my money to someone I have never heard of, accept no responsibility for the situation I am in now, and you want me to go and track it down and beg them to give it back?

CSR: yeah, sorry.

Got on Inspira's website, tried to use the automated tools to find my account, nope: ""Operation failed. Please contact client service"". After multiple calls I finally got ahold of someone, tells me to try again in a few weeks as the transfer from Fidelity can take that long. Wait a few weeks, call back, CSR now tells me that I need to fill out a form (PDF) and send it back to them with a picture of my driver's license. The form wants my SSN, mother's maiden, wife's name and SSN, I immediately knew this was going to be trouble, all of that should have come from Fidelity.

ok, fine. Filled the forms out except for the signature (**since I do not agree to the TOS**) and sent them back with all of my personal data attached on July 15th. Haven't heard anything back, just all of my data out there in someone's email box.

At this point it's been more than a month and I have lost, according to the last ROI in Fidelity, a month of 30% return. Inspira cannot locate my money, Fidelity doesn't care, and I am losing hope. I am not a big shot investor, this was my retirement fund. I trusted that Fidelity was looking out for me and they failed me big time.

The questions I have for the wiser Redditors is this: What can I do now? Is there a legal option for getting my money back? What kind of lawyer do I look for? I have an Employee stock purchase program and another 401k with Fidelity, should I escape before this can happen again?",lep18zp,Fidelity,"Employers have to pay an annual fee for for retirement accounts and some may choose to close your accounts so that they don't have to pay the annual fee or they may just continue to pay it so that you can continue your retirement account there. You had the option to roll it over into an IRA at Fidelity which is what I did when I left my job.

I had a pension with another company and they sent me literature on a regular basis on how the pension fund was doing and on options if I wanted to cash out. It's your responsibility to keep track of your assets and consider whether or not your money is in the right place.

That said, it can be difficult to find these funds to move them to the right place as there's currently a lot of financial fraud going on and the institutions have to be careful with releasing information, verifying identity and transferring funds as they are on the hook if something goes wrong.",0,movdqa,1,1721822477,2024-07-24 12:01:17,24 July 2024

I’m currently using Robinhood and want to switch to Schwab. Does Schwab meet what I’m looking for?,v0p83x,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlesSchwab/comments/v0p83x/im_currently_using_robinhood_and_want_to_switch/,"Hello! I’m currently using Robinhood to do recurring investments on ETFs and individual stocks. One thing it is missing is that I cannot select specific shares when I want to sell and its FIFO is not tax smart. Also it does not support auto rebalancing based on a portfolio setting. So Im looking for other platform.

Im looking at M1 Finance, Fidelity and Charles Schwab. My requirements are 

1. Can set recurring investiment on same dollar amount per week on single ETF, stock and bond. That is being said, the share for recurring investments will be frictional share.

2. Set a portfolio pie which I can set the percentage of my portfolio holding ETF, stock and bond, and can auto invest into the portfolio per month

3. Buy individual etf, stock and bond, and sell a specific share.

I think Schwab does not support buying frictional share of ETF, but if it supports recurring investment for a specific amount of money then it is also ok.

Another thing is, does it support selling a specific share for frictional share?

What to do?  Is there anyway to appeal this?  I have options approval at Fidelity, but ThinkOrSwim is a much better platform for options trading.

I am not sure I understand how you were trading options, but I do not want a margin account.  I am strictly a cash account player.  I do not want to write options, at all.  I do not even want to write covered options (because I have no interest in owning or selling the under-lying stock).  My strategy is very simple (and of course does not work more than half the time).... if the chart pattern indicates SPY will decline, I want to buy a put, if the chart pattern indicates SPY will rise, I want to buy a call.  I use Bracket orders (on Fidelity, they are called OTOCO orders.... One Triggers OCO.... which in turn is a One Cancels the Other).  I set my stop loss as a Trailing Stop as tight as Fidelity will allow, and my limit for my profit target around 10 to 1 (profit/loss ratio) almost always the profit target is not achieved and I get closed out by the trailing stop.  During my paper trading on TD-A, I was able to achieve a consistent $100-$200 win rate per day.... limiting myself to just 1 option contract at a time.  On Fidelity I usually scale up to 5-10 contracts per transaction.

Besides losing delta efficiency near the end of day, my biggest problem is that my strategy causes me to miss some opportunities, due to my tight stop loss being triggered.  But overall, I find that keeping loses small is the key thing.  Sometimes I set the stop loss too tight and the transaction incurs a small lose (my own faulty judgement).  But when I can read the chart correctly and set a good stop loss.... well the rewards can be quite amazing.",0,pawnslinger1,1,1684595945,2023-05-20 15:19:05,20 May 2023

Until about four months ago I received the rebate for every single executed limited trade. Furthermore is there math not adding up to the actual fee they charge.

Example about when I asked for the fees of a certain trade to be explained. So I set up to sell 60 AMZN shares at a certain amount. The order was filled minutes later. Here is their answer: ""Following is the breakup of the commission charged to you on your AMZN trade of -60 quantities executed on 19 September 2024:Total: 0.56 USDClearing fee: 0.012Exchange Fee: 0.126Execution fee: 0.35Finra trading activity fee: 0.00996Regulatory fee: 0.00025725Regulatory fee: 0.00312Transaction fee: 0.31540212""

The question about why there was no rebate included in the calculation was answered with let me quote: ""You might receive the rebate or you might not receive the rebate.""

No answer at all was given to the question how their calculation of fees adds up to $0.59 (Their own numbers add up to $0.816739). Also no answer is given to the question what the transaction fee is about. I can't find such a fee in their pricing structure.

On certain days I exceed 100 order fills. So their change in policy not to hand over the received rebate is adding up to a three digit number every month. Any advice?

Where would you invest it? Is their roboadvisor service worth it? I'd be looking to start pulling out of my RRSP's in 15yrs. RRSP's have previously been with big banks / group benefits using mutual funds / index funds. Thoughts welcome!,mhkzsn4,Wealthsimple,"It's not the best choice.. often promos from reputable banks offer the same interest rates. It could go down or up as well with the Bank of Canada changing rates. CASH.TO, from what I researched, uses the best high interest rates it can find. I think, for someone who wants all their money in one app, could consider CASH.TO as their main HISA instead of allocation of their accessible cash of their investments all over the place. I don't know, I'm a rookie, don't listen to me.",0,mountaingoatpat,1,1741880763,2025-03-13 15:46:03,13 March 2025
Looking for feedback on Moomoo's fees compared to Stake for US ETF trading,1g6b35h,https://www.reddit.com/r/moomoo_official/comments/1g6b35h/looking_for_feedback_on_moomoos_fees_compared_to/,"Hey everyone, I'm based in Australia and have been trading US ETFs using Stake, but their fees are a bit steep for me. Recently, I came across Moomoo and noticed that their fees are significantly lower. I'm considering switching but wanted to ask if anyone has experience with Moomoo in Australia—are there any hidden fees I should be aware of? Does Moomoo generally cost less than Stake? Thanks in advance for any insights!",lsi16mz,moomoo_official,"The overall fee depends on how much you plan on investing and how frequent you trade. If you trade very frequently, like on a daily or weekly basis, for US shares, moomoo's trading fee is cheaper, stake's fx fee is a bit lower though. I don't think hidden fee is a thing, they are usually clearly listed on the website.",1,MellowManZ,2,1729243221,2024-10-18 9:20:21,18 October 2024
About 15 minutes before closing bell,1js60vs,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkorswim/comments/1js60vs/about_15_minutes_before_closing_bell/,"Yesterday , Friday , about 15 minutes before closing bell , I was watching my Nvidia put on the options chain and watching the chart . Anyways I noticed that the asking price was like a dollar below the bid price . So I quickly called TOS SCHWAB and they just said it’s a known issue right now . So I had them tell me what is the correct bid ask price at the very moment, that was the only way to find out .  I don’t understand why there was this issue at all . Nvidia has high volume all the time . Did anyone have this issue on Friday ? I use the mobile TOS and the web TOS. and never had this happen.  ",mlk3myx,thinkorswim,So what are the alternatives?

I Love Charles Schwab,1cpmt6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlesSchwab/comments/1cpmt6r/i_love_charles_schwab/,"I just want to say I love Charles Schwab! They have the BEST customer service, and not just polite but they empower their customer service folks to take the action needed to satisfy whatever issue you are having.

Their Banking is awesome! Take money out of an ATM and they reimburse all fees you pay! They also don’t charge fees internationally and this is huge with my son being out of the Country. Totally free checking account and it’s professional! They have even adjusted ATM withdrawal limits for me which no other bank I’ve used has even thought of! They only lack physical banks, but that’s ok because rarely I have the need to deposit cash, and when I do I go to a local credit union.

Their investments are pretty great as well, and I need to utilize them more, but same level of service there too!

Anyway, just wanted to rave about them!",l3migut,CharlesSchwab,"I do use a regular bank too, but I do think Charles Schwab and a local credit union is a great combination. I recommend this for young people getting started. I have been very happy with my Charles Schwab Roth IRA. Their mutual fund selection is just awesome.",1,bamagraycpa,6,1715461657,2024-05-11 21:07:37,11 May 2024

"For those that use TD Ameritrade account for checking, this transition seems to be a cluster ...",1b9xetd,https://www.reddit.com/r/tdameritrade/comments/1b9xetd/for_those_that_use_td_ameritrade_account_for/,"I use my brokerage accounts at TD Ameritrade connected to a TD Bank checking account for ACH auto debits & credits, and sometimes for actuated credits (i.e., I actuate it rather than it being auto debit), and for debit card use - and I'm sure there are plenty of other customers that do this too.

It seems that this transition will be Schwab informing me of my new checking account sometime in early May, and with the TD checking account going DEAD on May 13.  All financial institutions seem to require a 30-day advance notice for changing the auto-pay checking account number, so obviously this transition is not going to work.  And even if I had the new checking accounts early, I will have to consult with every one of my auto-pay institutions about what EXACT day they will do the ACH - and of course, they don't like to give a straight answer for this.

&#x200B;",ku1cw3z,tdameritrade,"I can confirm that incoming deposits continued, but I can't say about debits because I was able to get everything switched over before payments were due. Well, one credit card issuer said the change wouldn't take effect until the next month, so I paid that from a Fidelity account.

One thing you might try is asking Schwab to issue you an account number and checking acct # in advance. If they won't, then open a Schwab account, fund it, and connect that to your auto-debits. When the rest of your TDA funds arrive, it will go into that account, or you can move your funds there. I was considering doing that as a last resort but ultimately everything worked out.",0,NightWriter007,1,1709966553,2024-03-09 6:42:33,09 March 2024
